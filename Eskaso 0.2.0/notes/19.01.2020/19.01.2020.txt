I'm finishing the level and then taking a break.
I want to give up. I need a break, if nothing else.
Fuck the title card and the tutorial cards.
I will send the finished product to my friend if I care to.

I must admit to myself that this game is a constant source of anguish.
But if I DON'T work on it, won't I feel even more useless...?
Well, tough shit. Time to learn self-love.

I don't even know where I'll end up this September.
I don't even know if there's anything I can do about it.
I'm afraid of it all, too.

Transitioning is the only answer, isn't it?
My parents will call the doctor tomorrow.
Time to scribble up some talking points.
If I break through here, I can do anything.

But first, I'll at least cobble together a spawner.
Okay, looks neat. Might finish during the next week.
