It's good to be back. Never thought old bugs would return, though.
So, what's on the agenda?

1) Fine-tune lazerboy's placement
2) Figure out what's wrong with Pause in DM
3) Implement Static
4) DM Level Design
5) Fix no-drop cues

Wow, i didn't expect #5 to be dealt with so easily. #1 was easy enough, too. I guess it's time for some harder ones.
#2 out of the picture. I feel like I'm playing on easy.
Let's see if creating something new is challenging.

Oh, I almost forgot -
6) Implement EAF
7) Draw EAF tutorial card
8) Turn Kalim around

#8 done. #3 cleared.
I'm tempted to call it a night. In GameMaker. I'll get right to drawing and designing in other software.
