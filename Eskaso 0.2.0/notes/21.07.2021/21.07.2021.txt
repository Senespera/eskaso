I might be able to finish StillWavering today.
I slowed down the final quote, now to change sprites.

I finished StillWavering, but I feel like I didn't do enough work today.
Fine, let's make some progress on Showdown till the video ends.

There. I imported all the sprites and created the room. Fine, I'll chart the stars as well.

There. I charted the stars. Now on to Wild Rift. Because League is inferior.

I'm back. I lost a game of poker to Ash Williams. I'll work on Showdown some more.

Oh, I almost forgot to add pulsating Desperate Isolation. Noted.

Phew, just transcribing the dialogue took a while. What can I say? I love exposition.
I guess I'll add Desperate Isolation and play some Yakuza 0.
Although I do need to find a source for Urumagh's voice.

I know I left quite a heap for my future self to dig through, But I think I did a fair amount of work today.
Also, regarding Urumagh's voice - how about "DA" from Portnoy's "DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT"?
