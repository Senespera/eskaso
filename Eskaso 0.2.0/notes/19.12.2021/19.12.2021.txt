Motivation low. Stormwind is back in my mind. Same one.
Must make game better by wednesday.
Added intro, press any button and short circuit.
Now for something harder.
Tutorial BP and CP.
Not to forget - STAGE COMPLETE and EAF tutorial. And longer invulnerability. And OPF tutorial.

Okay, I ended up implementing timerchange first. Now let's do something easy like STAGE COMPLETE
Okay did STAGE COMPLETE. Not sure if I should stop here for now. No, I'm being lazy.
No point in putting off the inevitable. Time to craft the tutorial.

You know what? I did half the work, the video is ending, A Change of Seasons is ending, it's almost midnight,
I think I deserve some gaming. Or Netflix. Either way, see ya tomorrow.
