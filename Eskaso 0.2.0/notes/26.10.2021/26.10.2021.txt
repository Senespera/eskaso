I'm still postponing it.
I'm here to propose a fix to Windows 95'ing and to implement the building, as I forgot all about it.
Also I'm finally listening to Dream Theater's new album.
I should probably also hide Гордость once I link the demo. It'd be a shame if someone important found it.

Windows 95'ing. Basically, if left/right is too large, do not blink. Simple. Now to decide on the number. 4?
I'll play Dragon's Maw to remember.
No, 2 should be enough.
Which is actually... 1? Because it's one per side. Let's somehow see.
Doesn't somehow seem to break anything. I'll assume it works. Now onto the building.

This is harder to think about, but basically: if x<~xmean and y>~ymean, create a building behind that goes up.
if ... create one that goes right. if ... down. if ... left.
The direction of movement will be given as a number. So... spdx and spdy?
Wait. I suddenly feel the urge to make the building slightly 3D. brb.

I did it and at the same time figured out that I can't realistically show the transition in 3D.
I'll stick to 2D then, I guess.
Wait. What if... I make one sprite per position? Let me try to mentally visualize to see if it's feasable.
I think so! Brb again.

Back. My visualization skills suck. But it'll still look slicker in 3D. I can try. If it looks real bad, I'll just revert.
Fuck, I just can't focus today. The horizontal line disappeared. B.R.B.
OR NOT. 
Okay, back to business. Where should their origin be? Well, they'll all be originating from the same spot, right?
Top left should work. Next, layers. How about Buildings and BehindBuildings? And BBBuildings for moving originators.
You CAN change the layer, right? Let's test that first.

Yes, you can. Now let's go NW-NE-SE-SW-NW.
I'm changing sth: direactions are based on sprites now.
I might not need BBBuildings after all. Just swap layers.

Infinite spawns. It's getting hard to think. But I must. It's such a tiny fucking thing.
Fuck. I feel so helpless. The music is supposed to be helping me.
Aaaaargh. I give up. I'll watch an episode of Hunter x Hunter and maybe come back with a redo.

I'm back and still got no clues.
Hmm... Hit is basically always true.
Ah, I see. The spawner always moves, not when the other one stops. I should add some sort of trigger.
Okay, the spawnee moves, but the spawner doesn't. Let's see what can be done...

It works! But the spawnee is in the upper layer...
I did it by only swapping layers when cd is false!
There. Now I just need to upload it, send it to the guy and... wait? Should I promote the game already?
I bet watching more anime will give me the answer.
What's up with sounds going from the left, though? Lemme see...
There. Negated x.
Oh. Forgot to make Urumagh salute. Right.

There. I'll back up this version and create an exe. That way, it'll be easier on my mind.
Back again. Forgot to delete testing text.

ONE LAST THING
I noticed that pausecounter appears when ULP ends. I'll remove that now.
