19:45. I'm not feeling up to it today. I'm having a bit of a headache.
But I'll try to take it step by step. To start with, upper leaves animation.
I'll start by copypasting the earlier leaves.
Idea: have a bigger angle when going counter-clockwise, and vv

20:28. Not what I expected but looks neat. I'll implement it to Turnover, too.
20:37. Done. Now... no, not the text. Renew ambience.
20:40. Now... the text...?
21:12. ...Done? I sort of just grabbed the sound I had, but it kinda sorta fits.
Now... I guess I could test the whole game...?
21:15.Start. Stop. Forgot to change the sprite to it being white-domed.
21:18. Wait wait wait. The fuck is going on in AuRe? Debugging time...
21:27. Tinkering feels wrong. Like I'm going to fuck something up in the future.
Oh well. Not like I have a choice for now.
21:30. Okay. Sorted. Full attempt 3. Go!
21:51. So, counting the momentary VK interruption and being stuck on the second level, it took me 20 minutes?
Not bad, not bad at all. A perfect length for a demo, if I say so myself.
Well, I guess this is it. Now all that's left is to muster up some courage and put this thing out there.
This time I'll try to focus on itch.io. But I'll probably upload it to GameJolt as well.
I wonder how much I'll postpone doing this.
