Not to forget - STAGE COMPLETE and EAF tutorial. And longer invulnerability. And OPF tutorial.
Thinking about how to even do EAF tutorial. Whatever, this is a problem for future Senespera.

Okay, how do I only spawn highlight once and have the time frozen while it's on? 
Well, maybe the latter is actually easy.

O-kay. I did the BP/CP tutorial. I choose to extend invulnerability now.
Checking invulnerability. Also testing Urumagh's lower speed. Seem to work.

Now to remove static and implement OPF tutorial. I'll come around to EAF eventually.
Static removed. Wowie. Now to the more intricate part. How do I do this?
I'll just pause the game and have "TRY THIS" written under the pentagram after 3 game overs.
Sounds easy enough.
Oh, and before I forget - color EAF boost as well
Wow, worked like a charm. Now to recolor and... that's it? Reupload and start marketing?
Okay, I'll do that I GUESS. To twitter I go... Wowie...
