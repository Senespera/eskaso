I feel like someone who has to work long hours and can never make enough time for spending with his family.
Except Eskaso is my family.
And by work I mean study.
I swear, honey. After this week, everything's gonna be just like in the old days.

Current ideas:
 Conditional Camera Shift (after charging) - 0:07. Should be x^2 instead of instant, but the basics work.
 Zoomable Game (currently for testing) - 23:55. It's in.
 Make RollBack slow down instead of rolling back so that everyone can be in view
 Make kommissars just slightly faster than Kalim. Don't just appear suddenly.
