Well, that sure was a break.
I feel slightly refreshed. LET'S DOIT

AGENDA:
1. Gradually reduce volume at finish
2. Create the Game Over scene
3. Blink white when hit

Wow, I'm a genius. Done the first bit already. 2 fast 4 u.
Actually, imma switch 2 and 3
Actually, boy does this take a while. I'd rather delay such rep tasks til the end
Wait, did I not finish the scared and resolute sprites? 
Whatever, I'll just plug them in afterwards.

16:16. Just had a delete-scare. Will backup this version when I'm done for the day.

17:52. Fuck. I'll have to create a copy of each VHS to go rightward. No, leftward. Wait.
Fuck. I meant to- okay, nevermind now. Leftward should be here.
18:18. O-fucking-kay. Did the lines. Now the actual Game Over. I'm tired thooo~

18:36. Okay, I left the relevant notes in the timer's ItWontLetYou.
Hope you're feeling better than me now, future me.
