22:38. I have actually been working all this time, believe that or not.
But I still haven't been kicked out of the uni. I must be doing something wrong.
Anyway, let's see if I overload this thing by dumping all my sprites here.

MoveLook naming: MovedirLookdir(Back/Front/CD)

Oh wait I've yet have to resize all that shit aren't i
I'll indulge the kommissar, but the cyclops will have to wait.

Yeah, didn't do much of anything today. I left a note in the kommissar's sprite script. Do that next time.
Actually, I finally finished my avatar. It's cute as hell. 
Totally worth the time I could've spent Eskasi or pulling my grades back up.
I sure hope all this stress I'm not yet experiencing won't compound and bite me in the back later.
