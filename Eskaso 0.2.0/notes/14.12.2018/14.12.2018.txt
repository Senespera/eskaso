This is the only way to get my thoughts out. This is pretty much my only place
And even if it means overexerting myself when I'm really tired, I just have to do it.
I'm usually paranoid that someone will come and read these really private entries,
But fuck it. No filter. Just for today. I feel like I have to honestly look at my own thoughts.

I am really tired and I just really want to have a cute boy in my life that would
smile as soon as I walk in, which would make me smile in return despite being tired,
ask me one or two really short and sweet questions just to show that he cares,
lie down with me, stare at me with a dreamy look as I gaze back,
hold me in his arms while I can barely move, lightly press me against his chest,
exchange a slow yet loving kiss, gently touch my face, the back of my head, the waist...
...and, after whispering a question I was dying to hear the whole time...
...and hearing the appreciation in my voice as I confidently agree...
...
...to love me slowly.

I'm not even feeling that awkward. 
Hey, KGB. Let me just label this for you: [BLACKMAIL MATERIAL]
God, I want to find someone like that for myself.
But I'd probably make their life miserable. What with Eskaso and all.
They do not deserve such burden. I must see this through to the end alone.
But... if, by some freak accident, someone like that will start making advances on me,
I don't think I can resist.

20:02. I'll try to sneak in some work later. Sorry. It's Friday.
