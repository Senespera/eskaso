Started watching Star Trek
HOLY SHIT A PARK IN THE CITY OF TOMORROW

All right, what's next? I guess I might as well put together a timer.
Where should it be displayed, though...?
Under Kalim? Probably won't be aesthetically pleasing.
Around Kalim? Iconoclastic, but probably won't fit.
Around the cursor? Likely won't be very visible.
At the very bottom? Like CotND? Might have overplayed, but this seems like the best option for now.

Regardless, I was hoping the timer could change color from cyan to pink as it drained.
Wow, first try. Save for the colors.

Why don't I make the timer go backwards for a change?
I've always wanted to make a bunch of one-lettered variables. Actually, more like "just now".

21:42. Another surprisingly conclusively productive day.
I don't quite know how to describe the results. It looks like... a VHS replay...?
