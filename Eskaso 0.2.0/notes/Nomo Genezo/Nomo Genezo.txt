How will I actually reveal the enemies' names in a timely manner?

Doesn't really address the question of timeliness, but what about posters on the walls?
"Sick of tinkering with Resistors and Redistributors? Become a Kommissar today!" 3 in one. Isn't that nice.
I would REALLY prefer to reveal Discovery's enemies' names before the tunnel, though.
Although I can't really think of another way to justifyingly shove in a picture of a Nurturer and an Obsession and The Creator and Wrath.

Oh, how about this: when an enemy is first introduced, have an arrow over their head appear with their name above.
Slap on a description in parentheses below if you feel like it ("Upgraded" Nurturer)

I like Suppressor, Pacifier kinda works, but... SH-13LD? And... Lil Joey...?
I mean, they all kinda fit Xenus's character, but... 
I feel like if I am to follow the genius of Discovery names...
I should make the names of the pursuser and the bomb reflect the theme of denying one's emotions.
And yes. I am ready to scrap that last Joey Wheeler reference if that's what it takes. I know, I'm beyond salvation.
