10:41. Hide your girls, fellas. I'm about to have a fun night.
If anyone wants to join me, I'm ready to welcome them with open arms.
I'll entertain them all night long with my filthy, long, massive playlist.
...Sorry.

11:02. Shut Ze Door!
11:15. Dun. Hope it's graceful enough.
Hmm... Just how much control should Bump take away?
Guess it wouldn't hurt to disdisable Move and reduce the speed 8-fold.

13:47. Kinda forgot about making notes, but yeah, I added Crawl and ReRe collisions.
14:05. Shots now do actual damage, but I still feel like I'm wasting time.
14:25. LIFE HACK: If you feel like you're being unproductive for no reason, it has a reason!
You've just done too much work and the astral realm has to slow you down to maintain balance!
Just kidding, stop making excuses.
I feel like working on textboxes.

19:58. Never mind, I guess.
I'm too hung up on falsely collecting hours in GameMaker.
So, I'll just leave in running and go on to do something else. Like drawing. I might be back.

0:06. 4 hours of Wasted Time. For this program- not me. I've been drawing. It's fun.
I'll keep drawing until I'm sleepy. I've felt like I've been going to bed when I don't want to lately.
Sounds childish, I know, but... it's worth trying. Allowing myself the pleasures I've been denying.
I'll keep the program running in case I want to write something else down.
