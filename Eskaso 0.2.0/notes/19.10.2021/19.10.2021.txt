My bad, forgot to add the stars. Then onto the rest.

17:15. Did the stars. On to the- what did I call them?- Turnover, CloseUp1 and DemoFinale
Oh, forgot to add steam.
17:30. Did'n'done. Time for turnover.
Updated HP just in case I forget.

18:16. Boy is adding in leaves tedious. And I haven't even gotten to the animation. But Kalim's path comes first.

19:20. Boy are the results underwhelming. But I can't be arsed to make them change directions consequentially.
Place the stars and onto CloseUp1.

19:40. Boy do I take long to place stars. Onto CloseUp1

20:10. Boy. Not saying it anymore. On one hand, I could start DemoFinale.
On the other hand, I might be tempted to finish it. Which I can't handle right now (building).
Fuck it. Will create the room and place the stars. This is the star day.

20:41. I'm tempted to complete the thing since there's no eSports tonight.
As long as I'm not exhausted, I must push forward. It's decided then. With all my strength-
The ending point will be "Thank you for playing!" because I haven't decided on the presentation of it yet.

20:53. So much for pep talk. I did everything except leaves and the text. Oh well. At least I was productive today.
