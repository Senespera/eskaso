It's sunday evening and I can't make myself work. Even with music.
Copying notes...
if k.hit==true, drag leftward until xx-x>=val. Then, after a pause hit=false, karm.hit=true.
drag arm leftward until x==k.x. Then, after a pause karm.hit=false, k.hit=true

Do it, and block text progression until k.x==0

Well, the rest'll be easier, so I can bow out for now. I just love seeing Viego in action.
