Wow, it's been a while. Sorry. Was busy pretending to study. And actually playing games.
But I'd never abandon you, baby.

I'm planning to implement OPF and add music. Should be easy enough.

I think I got pretty much everything right on the first try soundwise.
OPF should be a tiny bit more challenging.

Oh noes I forgot to reset music at Pause Escape.
Fixed. And I instated OPF. Things are looking good. 
I guess it's time to draw the post-level scene and get to testing...
...And the demo will be ready.
I'm scared.
