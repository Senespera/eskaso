i dont wanna make notes right now
okay
-change on button press and not dir change
-change on closest dir and not whatever it is right now
no im not depressed. look- i've managed to force myself to work.
okay fine
have some more of my stream of consciousness
but only because i'm having trouble keeping track of my thoughts whilst they're in my head
how do i change to closest angle.
well. how does this look in my head.
"change sprite to match the closest octangle"
am i justified in using 'for', then?
nah. that's the heavy artillery. i'd rather keep it nice, simple, and long.
cases in ranges. ye. lemme just look this shit up cuz i don't wanna do a bunch of if then elses.
oh. can't do that. well, fuck me. ifs it is.
one. more. time. split ting hairs. octangles are: 0,45,90,135,180,225,270,315,360.
i guess i should move 23 degrees clockwise and 22 counter-clockwise
so.. (337..22] (special) (22..67] (67..112] (112..157] (157..202] (202..247] (247..292] (292..337]
yay. now onto the other one. maybe i'll even manage to actually create an outline of the level today.
yay.
