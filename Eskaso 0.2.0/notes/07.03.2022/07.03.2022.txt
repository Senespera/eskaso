Apparently completing an all-new track is not enough for my conscience.
Fine, I'll put together a part of the stage.
But no background or DI.

I might try randomly generating stars.
Damn, I should try listening to the track without Synth Lead.
Everywhere except the solo, of course.

Fuck, I could've sworn I wrote the time I started. It was about an hour ago.
1:33. Anyway, I've done enough for today. Kalim flies, music plays, DD rolls.
Attempts on stars and fate next time.
