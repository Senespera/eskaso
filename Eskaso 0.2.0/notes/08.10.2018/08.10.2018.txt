19:02. Set a deadline today. 08.12.2018. Must have authoritarian regime ready and playable by then.
If I fail, I must feel immense guilt and drive to finish it as quickly as possible.
If I succeed, I must feel some semblance of peace, inspiration and satisfaction.
Something tells me I'm only setting myself up for disappointment. Oh well. When did that ever stop me?

Width~600, height~375. I'll try ramping it up to 400-500. 
Wait. 600/x =16/9. Fuck. I forgot how to solve these. 337? Yup.
