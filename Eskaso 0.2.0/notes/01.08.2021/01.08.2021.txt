I'm somewhat behind on my studies and I had been trying desperately to finish Pathfinder: Kingmaker.
However, I do have something today: Claw 3D!
But for now I'll just try to see what framerate best suits it.
I should also add Heavenscraper in the background for consistency's sake\
!
It's... it's... Beautiful.
To be honest, it looked like trash in Krita.
But at, say, solid 37 fps, it's gorgeus.
I'm pleased with myself today. I'll look at it again before cooking dinner.
