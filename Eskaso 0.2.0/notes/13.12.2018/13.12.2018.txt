ENOUGH. RESTING.
I got that goddamn newsletter about that goddamn Cowboy Bebop-inspired indie game
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!!
YOU'RE DOING IT ALL WRONG!
WHY ARE YOUR OBJECTS NAMED objx?! JUST CALL THEM x AND ADD A PREFIX TO EVERYTHING ELSE! WHICH ONLY NEEDS TO HAVE ONE LETTER!
AND WHY IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE METHOD SO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND?! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
NO. STOP. WRONG. BAD. WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS SO COMPLICATED?!
Not to mention, it's like you were making a game because you wanted to make a game.
Like it was little more than a canvas for your random fucking experiments.
THIS IS ALL SO WRONG!
I AM FULLY AWARE THAT I SHOULD NOT BE THIS ANGRY, BUT DAMMIT
IT JUST FILLS ME WITH SO MUCH ENERGY IT'S UNBELIEVABLE

Move aside. SOMEONE HAS TO SHOW THESE- THESE- THESE HERETICAL ANTIICONOCLASTS HOW IT'S DONE.
20:47. Make Kalim's lane switching work GRADUALLY and with PERSPECTIVE CHANGE.
20:50. Create a 3D effect for the Khrushchyovka walls. Use Khrushchyovkas themselves as walls for now.
THIS IS SO EASY AND SIMPLE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW OFF WHILE ALSO PRETENDING TO BE HUMBLE AND STUPID AND ARGH
I like this trigger. I should really start searching for things like this.
BUT IT'S USELESS IF I DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE TODAY! STARTO!
21:01. Switching between rails is now called Hop. I'm not calling it Sleeper. Not yet. That word is too cool. Maybe later.

21:54. Congradu-fucking-lations. You are so fucking slow. Hey, cut me some slack. I'm back from a break.
This should be easier. PERSPECTIVE CHANGE. No peeking. Okay, fine. Let's read up on the law of perspective.
22:02. What are those numbers. Fuck it, I'll try the usual shrink and then the 16:9 shrink.
22:39. See? I'm speeding up. Usual shrink works fine, but let's try another one anyway.
22:43. Weird. It doesn't look too out of place, but... No, I'll keep the usual shrink. Looks like she's pulsating. Onto the walls.
23:26. Pretty much works. 3D will only work with own sprite, though. Will need to change xscale, too.
