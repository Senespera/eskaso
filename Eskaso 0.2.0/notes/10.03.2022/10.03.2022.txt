I spent today eating pizza, agonizingly listening to a lecture, sleeping, playing FFXIV and reading D&D rulebook.
Time to make today even more productive.
Testing SotSfate.

FUCK WHY DIDN'T I TIME IT AGAIN
2:32. It's been an hour, i think. I can't cue sh13lds for some reason. Even though I only changed the sprites.
They're still koms. What if I revert the sprites? For test's sake.
It IS the sprites! Now to cross-reference every instance of KEF...

2:44. Investigation turned up nothing. I'm feeling sleepy. But I must crack this case!
IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR HUGE SPRITES OVERLAPPING
So I shrunk them. I'm actually kind of worn out rn. 
2:50. Seeing resulting DImist and calling it a night.
Looks okay. Byeeeeeeeeeeeee
