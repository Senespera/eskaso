Hi. Didn't expect to be back so soon, but...
I'm here to at least begin to autosave...
...And SMASH- deleting obsolete resources.

17:01. Done smashing. Let's get to saving

18:49. What if the player exits at the LS-16 screen?
That must not be allowed to happen. Simply remove SavenLoad from that room?
18:53. Yup, I think I'm done. I'll have time to think about this later.
