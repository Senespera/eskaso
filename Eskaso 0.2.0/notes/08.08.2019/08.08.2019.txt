Let's actually complete something today.

Let's try 20 frames per jump.
Fuck, what was the ^2 math again...?
I want to make it acc towards the halfway point, then reset the speed, then acc again
(x-halfTIME)^2, as a speed function, will go fast-slow-fast just WHEN I need
so... y+=(counter-halftime)^2?
can't wrap my mind around it. i need DISTANCE over... time? haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
y+=(counter-sqrt(way))^2?
fuck it let's check that. for the first time in so long.
Nope. it just fucks off into nonexistence.
let's minituarize counter and see what's going on
aaaaaaaaaaaa
x*(counter-10)^2 = way
x=way/(counter-10)^2
i suck at this
no, i can't do it
not today
no number magic after all
