Happy 10 year anniversary, Skyrim.
To congratulate myself on actually studying today, I will only be removing minor bugs today.
For full to-do list see 09.11.2021

Fixed slowing down music in UnPo
Made sure all sounds stop in VAE just in case.
Reduced crawling duration
Disabled OPF turning off at Game Overs.
Added a snarky comment doing the above.

Only took about half an hour. Despite Wild Rift, today has been a surprisingly productive day.
