14:58. Am I ready? I don't know. I suspect that I'm happily decomposing. Work. Because you can
Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy.
Forgot to resize...
Have to set origin, too...
waaaaaaaaaaah.

23:37. Yeah, I've done it. Why are you acting surprised?
Only things to work on: CD sprites (i think that was a good idea, but i don't feel like that was a good idea)
And the whole CLOSER to the angle and not BARELY OVER the angle thing.
Marked some funny-looking sprites for an eventual redraw.
Oh, and actually direct the stresswave. Yeah, that'll probably be nice.-done
Damn, I only have like 2 weeks left. I feel like I should accept the fact that I aimed too high.
But facts don't care about your feelings and I will show myself just what I can do when my back's against the wall
Oh, and make Kalim able to switch between different charging sprites.
