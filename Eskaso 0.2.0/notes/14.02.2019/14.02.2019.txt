I don't know who I am. I don't know how to find myself.
Am I a girl? Or just... quirky?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know...

I was never bothered by this holiday. I enjoy being left alone.
But I'm being continiously reminded that I am not ready to answer any questions.
How am I supposed to discuss religion, politics, culture or friendship, 
when I can't even answer the most basic questions?
"What is your gender?" "What is your sexual orientation?" "Are you enjoying life?"

I am completely incapable of looking into the future.
The person that will inhabit this body five years from now will be so different,
and will know so many more things than I can even imagine,
that there's simply no use speculating.
Why hope? Then again, why fear?

I'm halfway through the holidays. My energy is not replenishing.
Now I have my answer. I was never overworked. It's something in my head.
I'm being worn out by my internal struggle. There's no escaping it for now.
Is there anything I can do other than dance through it...?

...if only I had the guts to buy something to put myself at ease.
Or find someone to put myself at ease, I guess. 
But... that doesn't seem very likely.
Love is hard. I can't even do it to myself.
Will I be able to do it to others? Will others be able to to it to me?

I want to bash my head against a table.
Save me. Someone. Show me- clearly- what I am.
Is this the kind of desperation that turns people to religion?
Well, fuck that. I'm not erasing my identity. 
I will figure it out. It's only a matter of time.
Now let's see how much work I can do in this miserable state.

This resize thing annoys me. Assign a scale to each rail, and resize gradually.
 Goddammit, stop filling my mind with such teasing imagery. I MUST FINISH THIS.
Pullback. Argh. Just... reverse the rail speed, and then x^2 it back. Sure.
