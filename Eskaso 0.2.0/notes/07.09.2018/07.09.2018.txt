0:00. Maybe I should take a break after all...? Wait, I thought I took a break yesterday. Or was that the day before?
Checked it. I've been slowing down. Games don't quite do it for me right now. GameMaking is getting tiring, too.
Just how far should I push before taking a break? Before I absolutely will have to take at least ONE DAY off eventually.
Completing the first level? Hahahahaha.
...That would propel me quite far ahead, wouldn't it?

0:10. The best way to figure out what I want would be to actually create the levelwall with the correct scale.
But fuck me if I'm going to destroy my RAM and brain tonight. What else is on the list...?
I GUESS I could take a look at the textboxes...? Not sure. Maybe I should just leave this day with just drawing.
...Speaking of drawing, I guess it's about time I chose that tablet, huh? Yeah. I've been delaying it for long enough.
Tomorrow is going to be terribly uneventful. I just feel it. Let's clear some of that baggage.

0:14. It's decided, then. Got myself a levelswitch and drew #30.
Oh well. At least I won't get any less productive than this.
Might even work on music tomorrow.
