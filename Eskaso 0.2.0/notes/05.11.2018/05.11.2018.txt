Tear down these walls for me, now. I mean- build them.
 Levelwall can be a collection of objects, right...? Let's test this out. ARLW1-2!
 I probably won't be using this system much if I'm smart about wall shapes, but LEARNING.
 
23:40- Nice. But! Considering the wacky hitboxes... Oh, I know!
Hey, ESKASISTO FROM THE FUTURE! It's me! ESKASISTO FROM THE PAST!
And I'd like to give you a hint about WALLS, HITBOXES and GETTING STUCK.
If: you were FINE BEFORE the SPRITE CHANGED, but got STUCK AFTERWARDS, MOVE AWAY.
...Actually, that sounds convoluted as fuck.
The problem should go away if you just give all the sprites the same origin and draw the hitbox around it.
It's just a hunch, though. I haven't actually drawn much yet. Sorry. 
Eh, you're smarter than me. You'll figure it out.

Keep the game zoomable for now. Just make it faster. -done.

Update: if NE and N are going to be the same sprites, for instance, same origin won't solve the issue.
Do something with TheseWalls including x/y_offsets or something. Like teleporting using the offsets.
..I'm just picturing kalim rotating smoothly from NE to NW. Nah. Too jarring.
...Worst case scenario? You're going to have to use distance_to_object and QuickSpell outta there.
IT'S NOT THE TIME. THINK OF A PROBLEM YOU CAN SOLVE RIGHT NOW. I CAN'T. IT'S 0:01.
Last thing: visualize the solvation or whatever the fuck it's called:
Kalim is NE'ing at the northern wall. She then changes to N. Which causes her to...
Wait, I don't think we're actually going to have a problem in this scenario. Nevermind.
SHE CHANGES TO E. RIGHT. The solution. No. Wait. Fuck. 
It's the same circle anyway. Nobody's getting stuck. Probably.

OKAY ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE. I'M CLEARLY MORE IN THE MOOD FOR WRITING. Orevooare or however the fuck it's spelled.
