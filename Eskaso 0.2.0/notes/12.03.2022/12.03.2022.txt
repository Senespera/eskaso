19:26. I slept through all the classes again. I'll have to catch up later.
My goal for today is FINISHING THE DAMN LEVEL THAT'S RIGHT. THAT MEANS:
-Tuning DI TICK
-Tweaking buildings
-Decreasing SH13LD size in-sprite TICK
-Implementing the level TICK
-Creating the ending TICK

I pretty much only ate peas, nuts and papaya today. Might take a bean break. Or make a granola.
Oh, yeah. I forgot about battletoads. Should be easy enough to copy from ULP.

22:09. I implemented the level and created the ending. Major bugs are absent.
But honestly I'm spent. I'll create OPF version and retire to FFXIV.
Future me will be happy with how little work is left. Maybe he'll increase the challenge, that fucker.
I'll leave the battletoads just for the hell of it. 
You'll still be able to beat the game even if you hit every single one.
22:17. I did fine. Peace out.
