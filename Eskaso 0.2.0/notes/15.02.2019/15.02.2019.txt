well, i did half of what i wanted yesterday.
couldn't get much sleep last night. overtaken by fantasies.
i know it's pathetic, but goddammit, i want a kiss so bad...
even demisexuality feels like a curse sometimes.

apparently, it's healthy to do the following at times like this:
 do what makes you happy/feel like yourself
 talk to those close to you
 rest
i think i tried all of those. i'm hopeless. maybe i am depressed after all.
sure, i might as well check the symptoms before carrying on.
although it might just be the weather. it hurts on the inside.
i feel like i'g going downhill. nothing brings me pleasure.

all right, let's try to feel a little less worse about yourself.
 Pullback. Argh. Just... reverse the rail speed, and then x^2 it back. Sure.
  bashing my head against a stool alleviated the pain a little.
  done. nuances can wait. i want to squeeze out some enjoyment from somewhere.
  desperately.
