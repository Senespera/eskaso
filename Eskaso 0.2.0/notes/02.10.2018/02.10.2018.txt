23:48- sorry, not doing much in terms of putting things together anytime soon.
Actually, I might. I just feel like finishing some things.
No, the obsession hasn't gone away.
Yes, satisfaction is still illusory.

23:57. Too sleepy to tell what I'm doing.
Um, I guess I should circularize the sprite somehow. Or not. If it's only the hitbox I care about.
