21:54. Still buried. Been told there's absolutely no risk, though. Will do everything I can to get it out until who knows when.
I just really don't want to go to the ER. I don't want to communicate my issue to other humans.
If discomfort gets worse, my shame will wear itself out, or my parents pressure me, I'll go. 
Until then, I'll trust the good doctor and try to force it out.
22:00. Okay, back to more relevant notes.
22:04. I'll go for something simple for today. Redistributors. 
It won't appear in 1-1, I know. I'll try to stay on target in the future. I'm still making important stuff, though.

22:08. TIME TO HAUL MY RESPONSIBILITIES BACK HERE AGAIN.
 Redistributor - shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Timer Alpha Blink
 Cue/Bump Overhaul
 Dash Economy

22:58. Redistributor should still not affect Dash.
23:13. Enough staring at the screen.
I really don't like how much time the timer spends purple. How about only transitioning between 40% and 60%?
23:26. ...how do I squish it, though?
23:33. I guess I need to create a way for tmax to go from MAX to 0 when from 0.6 to 0.4.
A variable that drops from 1 to 0 depending on t/tmax, then? Just give me the formula.
0.6=1, 0.4=0. 0.5, evidently,=0.5? Weird. X=(t/tmax-0.4)*5? Hey, it works!
23:53. No, it doesn't! Well, mid to pink seems smooth enough, but not cyan to mid.
...Replace t/tmax with THE variable...?
23:57. N i c e.

23:58. I miss the VHS HUD-looking timer now. Let's scratch the current alpha thing right now.
Alpha Blink sounds cool on its own. I'm going to need to numberize some things, though.
INTERMISSION: Octagoj is about going beyond- it needs to be the NEXT day of the week to work. 8 is the difference between the last and the first day.
How fast does it Blink by the end? Like, a full rotation in 20 steps? It's difficult to picture, but at first it's... 120 steps?
What is the alpha's lower limit? And a higher one, if that's what you go for. 0.1 AND... 1. ...Right? It just moves from one to the other with time.
And does it start off more or less transparent? Ah, I'll implement both and decide afterwards. Doubt it'll make the choice easier, though.
So, go from (see both directions) 0.1 to 1 in 120 to 20 steps. And there's no way I can figure out a way to create this dynamic system at 0:20. G'night.
