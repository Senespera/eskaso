Not feeling too cool, but it turns out I've got all my sprites.
Once again,
1. Blink White when hit
2. Finish Game Over sequence (sprites and sounds)

15:11. Blink done. I guess with #2 done I'll... move onto the next level...?
Woah. Hold yo horses.

15:16. You know what? My Resoulte Kalim kinda looks like shit.
I'll just use soopk5 instead. Duplicate it and see how it sticks

15:27. Needs upscaling. I call upon you, Paint.net.

15:51. Spritework done, onto the sounds.
16:05. Wow, I... I think I may be done for now.
It's the strangest feeling every time.
Next time, I'll be drawing an inside of a bus and...

Wait. I still need SFX for CP, ANH and BP
And I haven't even begun implementing OPF!
Not to mention the title card and tutorial cards...

1. Find and/or make SFX for ANH, CP and BP
2. Make tutorial cards
3. Make the title card
4. Create the Pause Menu (Continue, OPF, Quit)
5. OPF
6. Figure out saving and implement autosaving at the start of each room.

It's the strangest feeling every time.
