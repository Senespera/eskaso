23:58. I wonder what should I do tomorrow. I'll be 19 years old, I mean.
I didn't do ANYTHING last year. Probably out of stress. I don't think I even took Eskaso that seriously.
If it wasn't obvious enough, I skipped 27.08.2018 because I visited a doctor that day.
Okay, that probably wasn't a good excuse. I think it just slipped my mind somehow.
This day marks the end of the second Octago anyway. Not the most productive one.
Oh well. They can't all be winners.
Huh. I expected much more self-loathing. 
Troubling. I should push myself tonight. What can I do in an hour, though...?

Argh. I can't think of anything SPECIAL to do tomorrow! And I am in desperate need of something!
My mind goes to Stormwind. But no. Absolutely ridicilous. Don't have anything to say, too.
And no. Not the literal Stormwind, either. I refuse to return to WoW until it overpowers my heart again.
It's no use. I can only HOPE something cool enters my mind tomorrow.

0:17. ...Nothing feels important enough to be worked on. You know what's actually important? Substanitive?
Sprites. Music. Story. Gameplay just feels hollow right now.
Although... I guess I could work on something new. Not another project, though.
Only if it serves Eskaso in a meaningful way.
I meant working on later mechanics before putting together the first level.
BUT OH WAIT I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH THE DOORS?

1:01. Hm. Finished the basic thing on the first try after juggling creation code.
I guess I could also block the path... by cleverly creating a wall?
You know, using sprite_width to determine image_xscale?
Yeah, that might work, actually. Stop lazing around and at least resize the door's canvas.

1:33. I did it. And then I remembered that Kalim only collides with levelwall.
So... update the level sprite instead? Yeah, sounds good.
Not right now, though. I'd like to get some sleep before tomorrow.
So yeah, not going to recap, either. G'night.
