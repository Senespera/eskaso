text[1]="Hey."
text[2]="I'm Urumagh. You know, the overlord of the sector.";
text[3]="A revolutionary like yourself should probably know that much already.";
text[4]="Anyway, you've got something that belongs to me. Now hand it over.";
text[5]="...Unless you want to find out exactly how I've managed to remain in power for this long.";
//Kalim
text[6]="Why do you want this stupid thing so much anywa-";
//Urumagh
text[7]="NO RESPECT AT ALL!";
text[8]="Name and occupation. Now. Oh, by the spirits... Am I the only one who cares about due process around here?";
//Kalim
text[9]="...Um, my name is Kalim, and I'm... er... um...";
//Urumagh
text[10]="Come on, out with it! A commissar? A builder? A maid, perhaps?";
text[11]="Whatever the case, it's very ungrateful of you to abandon your post like that.";
text[12]="Our lives are the only ones that have any purpose around here. Good thing I destroyed all those robots every other sector relies on.";
text[13]="And don't even try to tell me you're unemployed. Home-dwellers are too unmotivated to revolt like you did.";
//Kalim
text[14]="But I didn't revolt! And if you really want to know what I do, well...";
//Urumagh
text[15]="...";
//Kalim
text[16]="..."
text[17]="I'm... a wanderer, basically. I just sort of travel around the station, taking in the scenery and looking for...";
text[18]="Actually, that's not really relevant right now. Point is, I'm completely harmless!";
//Urumagh
text[19]="Say that to the poor bastards downstairs.";
//Kalim
text[20]="I wasn't being myself! Eskaso made me do it!"
//Urumagh
text[21]="I DON'T CARE WHO MADE YOU DO IT!";
text[22]="*sigh*";
text[23]="Look, I'm gonna be straightforward. Letting you rot in jail would be a terrible loss.";
text[24]="Which is why I've decided to make you an offer: I get the legendary weapon you've found..." ;
text[25]="Those good-for-nothings could learn a thing or two from you. Somebody will somehow have to maintain order around here when I'm gone, too..."; 
//Kalim
text[26]="(''If things continue as they are''? As in, if the next uprising succeeds? I wish. Nobody in the sector could possibly beat him! What is he afraid of?!)";
text[27]="I'd rather just give this thing to you and NOT serve in- wait, ''legendary weapon''?";
//Urumagh
text[28]="Don't you know the story? There was once a ruler who controlled the entirety of the Lonely Seeker.";
text[29]="He would press it against his forehead and pray to the spirits before each battle, and he would win every time.";
text[30]="At the dusk of his life, he sealed the weapon on top of the Heavenscraper, looking over the lands that now belonged to him.";
text[31]="However, one night, an unidentified graverobber stole the pole and hid it in an old building. The station was once again divided soon after.";
//Kalim
text[32]="I spent my whole childhood here and this is the first time I'm hearing this story.";
//Urumagh
text[33]="W-What?!";
//Kalim
text[34]="Are you sure you didn't just hear it from someone who'd made it up before pretending to know it so as not to look uneducated...?";
//Urumagh
text[35]="Enough with the lies! You've heard it, just like everyone else on the station! Why else would you be rummaging through run-down houses?!";
text[36]="Hmm. Unless...";
//Kalim
text[37]="Oh, I-I just figured I'd visit one of the oldest buildings on the station, you know?";
text[38]="Apparently, it was a home to the inventor of Nurturers!";
text[39]="It looked about as depressing as I expected.";
text[40]="It basically screamed ''I'm the type of person who'd create a way for parents to completely entrust their child to a machine if that means not having to look after the stupid thing!'' Urgh! It was terrible!";
text[41]="...So, I guess you could say I was just paying a visit to the birthplace of my ''parents''.";
//Urumagh
text[42]="...";
text[43]="So, you're saying you found the legendary weapon in your parents' house...?";
text[44]="...!";
text[45]="YOU FILTHY THIEF SPAWN.";
//Kalim
text[46]="Wait, wait, wait! That's not what I-";
//Urumagh
text[47]="THINK YOU CAN FOOL ME?!";
//Kalim
text[48]="(I want to go home...!)";
//Urumagh
text[49]="Forget the offer! I'll wipe the floor with you for trying to rob the station of its future!";
text[50]="You're just as guilty as your graverobbing ancestor! You've been hiding this weapon from its rightful heir for centuries!";
//Kalim
text[51]="E-Even if that were true, w-wouldn't the statute of limitations run out by now?!";
//Urumagh
text[52]="You there! Drop my weapons!";
text[53]="...";
text[54]="Only those who learn to live with the pain can hope to leave their mark on the world. That's what my old man taught me, may the bastard rest in peace.";
text[55]="While this armor protects me from any external damage, the power that flows through my weapons overloads every nerve cell that it comes into contact with, inflicting pure pain.";
text[56]="That way, I have nothing to be afraid of. You have no power over me.";
text[57]="It's fear of pain that prevents most people from doing the right thing. My father knew that. This armor represents his ideals perfectly.";
text[58]="His last words... Wisdom to live by...";
text[59]="''Don't be a wimp.''";
//Kalim
text[60]="...!";
text[61]="(He must've been through many battles like this. No wonder he's so messed up in the head. Poor guy...)";
text[62]="(WAIT, WHAT AM I THINKING?! HE'S ABOUT TO KILL ME!!)";
//Urumagh
text[63]="I have one last request for you, traitor...";
text[64]="At least make it entertaining!";
//Kalim/Lonely Seeker
text[65]="I GUESS YOU REALLY DO HAVE A DEATH WISH.";
