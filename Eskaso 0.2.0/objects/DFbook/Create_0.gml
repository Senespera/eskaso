text[1]="Well, that was a wild night...";
text[2]="...I have no idea what to do with myself again.";
text[3]="I should probably be thinking about my next destination."
text[4]="Not sure why I wanted to go to the Heavenscraper so badly. It's just a government building."
text[5]="Unless the Navigators can give me a hint as to where I belong, I'm not interested."
text[6]="But then again, do I have any better ideas? I'm not going to find any luck in the Innovation Sector, that's for sure."
text[7]="Even if I was qualified to work alongside all these inventors, scientists, entrepreneurs and other kinds of losers."
text[8]="UGH."
text[9]="Get a grip, Kalim."
text[10]="Get a life."
text[11]="It's this damn thing's fault. Eskaso, was it? If it wasn't for you, I'd be..."
text[12]="...probably about as lost as I am right now, actually."
text[13]="But at least I wouldn't be running away from law enforcement and fighting reptilian overlords for no reason!"
text[14]="What was that sound?"
text[15]="Is... something inside?"
text[16]="AH!"
text[17]="A-Are you okay...?"
text[18]="Y-Yeah, I think... Don't worry abo-"
text[19]="(That voice sounds very familiar. Could it be...?)"
text[20]="No. Way."
text[21]="Someone pinch me."
text[22]="Am I actually looking at VI THE SIXTH HERSELF?!"
text[23]="Um, yes, that's me. And you are...?"
text[24]="IYOUVICANTVITHESIXTHISREALLYHAPPENING"
text[25]="(Kalim.exe has stopped working.)"
text[26]="K-KALIM! NAME'S KALIM! M'AM! I- I MEAN YOUR BRILLIANCE!"
text[27]="Um, well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Kalim."
text[28]="Is everything all right?"
text[29]="!!!"
text[30]="Your Brilliance!"
text[31]="I've been following you ever since you started advocating for publishing the Lonely Seeker's course!"
text[32]="I never would've gotten interested in politics if it weren't for you!"
text[33]="You're my idol! Seeing you carry on despite all the stuff the Navigators did to stop you inspired me so much!"
text[34]="You taught me perseverance - your words literally cost you a hand and a foot, but you only became bolder!"
text[35]="Oh, that wasn't really much of a hindrance - I can get a prosthetic anytime I want, after all."
text[36]="I mean, I got one for my tail as soon as I got elected."
text[37]="Oh? What about your hand, then?"
text[38]="I just... don't see any point anymore."
text[39]="...?"
text[40]="A-Anyway, were you saying something about the sixth presidential election?"
text[41]="Oh, that! Your Brilliance was the only real candidate there!"
text[42]="I never stopped believing in you - even when everyone else did - after you suddenly resigned shortly following your victory."
text[43]="Firstly, please, just call me Vi. O-OR Miss Vi, if that's... um... more comfortable for you."
text[44]="Although it's a little weird, hearing a peer call me that..."
text[45]="But secondly, it's nice to see such enthusiasm persist despite certain realities crushing the will of everyone else."
text[46]="May I ask you... What gets you out of bed every morning?"
text[47]="Oh, I just don't want to be like all those other losers who choose to waste away in their homes."
text[48]="They're always saying some nonsense like ''I don't need to work - the station's every service is fully automated and doesn't need me at all.''"
text[49]="Or ''What's the point of doing anything? What can I possibly change? Everything I used to care about is outside my control.''"
text[50]="Or - and this is my favorite one - "
text[51]="''You still care about that stuff? Honey, when I was your age, I had already long accepted the fact that the station doesn't care about you or where you want it to go.''"
text[52]="''Forget this nonsense about surfing through space and changind the world or whatever.''"
text[53]="''You're chasing an illusion. It'll never make you happy. Go out and find yourself someone who could get your head out of the clouds and make you experience TRUE joy.''"
text[54]="I honestly get more sad than angry when I hear this sort of thing."
text[55]="I mean, what drove them to become like this...? There is literally nothing stopping them from voting on their dream destination!"
text[56]="You... still haven't figured it out? I mean, I tried to keep it under the rug, but I felt like everyone caught on by now anyway."
text[57]="You see, I managed to give the Navigators an ultimatum that basically forced them to share the course with me."
text[58]="And just when everyone thought they could finally learn when they'd reach the destination of their dreams..."
text[59]="On second thought, forget I said anything."
text[60]="You keep doing you. Those guys are just losers. Like myself."
text[61]="What?! Miss Vi, have you given up on your dreams as well?"
text[62]="No, it can't be. You're, like, the SYMBOL of resilience and determination! Only The Creator themself inspired more people to forge a brighter future than you!"
text[63]="I did, only to let them down once again... At least The Creator was lucky enough to die before seeing the station overcome with disappointment as the result of their actions..."
text[64]="That does it! Sorry if I'm being intrusive, but I won't take no for an answer."
text[65]="Miss Vi, you taught me to never lose hope and to press on twice as hard when I hit rock bottom."
text[66]="If it weren't for you, I'd be just like all the others."
text[67]="I can't think of a better way to repay you for making me into who I am than inspiring you back, Miss Vi."
text[68]="Now then, what is your dream?"
text[69]="I'm afraid you're overstepping your boundaries, and-"
text[70]="Please don't talk about those kinds of things with me."
text[71]="...What was that just now?!"
text[72]="I wouldn't bother asking if I were you. It'll leave me alone soon enough... but only if you do as well."
text[73]="That looks scary... and painful."
text[74]="You are forgetting your place."
text[75]="(Miss Vi clearly has some sort of violent aversion to something I said. I probably shouldn't push her too hard. For now.)"
text[76]="I'm sorry, Miss Vi. I acted way out of line. However, I'm afraid you won't be able to stop me."
text[77]="I will stick around until you overcome this weird ailment and once again shine with determination!"
text[78]="*sigh*"
text[79]="I can't be bothered to protest anymore..."
text[80]="No, no, no, no, no! You should be yelling at me relentlessly! Come on, Miss Vi! Show me that legendary spirit of yours!"
text[81]="Heh. I'd love to be able to do that... I could really use some of that energy you're radiating."
text[82]="I guess I don't have anything better to do, anyway. Fine. I'll tag along."
text[83]="What did you have in mind?"
text[84]="!"
text[85]="(I... I didn't actually expect her to agree! Much less so quickly!)"
text[86]="(...What DID I have in mind...?)"
text[87]="...Hello? You did have something planned for tonight, right? Did that fall knock it out of your head?"
text[88]="Ummmmmmmmmmm... (If I say ''yes'', will she be LESS angry with me...?)"
text[89]="*sigh*"
text[90]="I guess you're the one who could use some help right now."
text[91]="Let's see... maybe you wrote something down in that diary of yours?"
text[92]="My what? Oh, right. That. Not sure how it managed to slip my mind."
text[93]="It's not mine, though. I just sort of found it inside this cue. It's a long story."
text[94]="(Actually, it's really not. I just don't like talking about cues. Or anything related to billiards, for that matter.)"
text[95]="(I really, REALLY hate billiards. Ugh. I'm getting stressed out just thinking about it.)"
text[96]="It seems to be someone's journal. I think it's written in some kind of... Human?"
text[97]="Human? Really? It's been a while since I last read something from them. Mind if I take a peek?"
text[98]="That wouldn't be right... How about we try to find the author instead?"
text[99]="That's what I'm proposing we do. I just don't think you know the language well enough to deduce who the author is. Can you read even a single word there?"
text[100]="......''S   a   d      l   i   f   e''...?"
text[101]="Nice try. Humans say that all the time. Do another one."
text[102]="(Looks like she caught me.)"
text[103]="...''E   s   p   e   r   o   y    k   a   i    s   o   n   j   o   y''...? (I have no idea what that means.)"
text[104]="OKAY FINE JUST TAKE IT I SWEAR I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU"
text[105]="...I guess I'll have to read it if I want to find the owner, huh...?"
text[106]="I'll take a look at it once I find a place that's less accessible to falling cyclopes. I'll call you if I find something."
text[107]="Huh? But I didn't give you my number..."
text[108]="Oh, please, Kalim. I'm from the Discovery Sector, remember?"
text[109]="We just know."
text[110]="?!"
text[111]="Just kidding. You forgot to disable your signal, which I already caught. Be more careful while I'm gone!"
text[112]="Unless you want to end up face to face with some shadowy reptilian overlord!"
text[113]="CYCLOPS."
text[114]="?! (Well, that was quick. Hold on a second...)"
text[115]="YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN POSESSION OF SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPERTY."
text[116]="KINDLY PLACE THE OBJECT IN QUESTION INTO THE NEAREST TRANSFER TUBE IN ORDER TO INITIATE THE DELIVERY."
text[117]="Wait, wait, wait. There's a misundedrstanding! See, the previous owner told me I could have it. Ask Urumagh yourself if you don't believe me!"
text[118]="(This doesn't make any sense. Urumagh wouldn't send someone after me, would he?)"
text[119]="(And even if he would, they wouldn't be able to get far, seeing as this territory is outside his jurisdiction.)"
text[120]="IRRELEVANT. URUMAGH WAS NOT CERTIFIED TO GRANT YOU OWNERSHIP OF ESKASO EITHER."
text[121]="What? (Wait, he knows Eskaso's name! I guess it's not surprising, considering it's apparently a legendary weapon and all. Although...)"
text[122]="(Miss Vi is rather knowledgable, and she didn't seem to notice...)"
text[123]="URUMAGH WAS NEVER AN OWNER OF THIS ITEM, NOR DID HE EVER HAVE ANY CLAIM TO IT. NOW COMPLY. YOUR GRACE PERIOD IS RUNNING OUT."
text[124]="I mean, it WAS just laying around in an abandoned building. It was kind of up for grabs."
text[125]="INCORRECT."
text[126]="IT WAS PREDICTED THAT URUMAGH'S FORCES WOULD BE SEARCHING FOR ESKASO IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME."
text[127]="IT WAS PLACED THERE BY THE TRUE OWNER SPECIFICALLY SO THAT URUMAGH WOULD ''FIND'' IT. NOW RETURN IT."
text[128]="...That makes no sense. Why wouldn't the ''true owner'' just give it to Urumagh directly?"
text[129]="And even if there was any truth to what you're saying, how would you know any of this?"
text[130]="THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL."
text[131]="Figures."
text[132]="PLEASE CONFIRM YOUR REFUSAL TO RETURN THE ITEM IN QUESTION TO ITS OWNER SO THAT AN INTERCEPTION TEAM CAN BE DISPATCHED."
text[133]="Hey, I never said I DIDN'T want to have this thing as far away from me as possible!"
text[134]="(I've had enough police chases for the night. This stupid thing fills my head with stupid thoughts and tries to get me killed!)"
text[135]="(Nice try, Eskaso, but I choose to live a normal life now.)"
text[136]="I'd be more than happy to get rid of it. This thing's been nothing but trouble for me anyway. (Not to mention, it's basically a cue, which only adds insult to injury.)"
text[137]="DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DECEIVE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU ARE BEING MONITORED."
text[138]="Yeah, I kinda already figured that out."
text[139]="Yes, Miss Vi?"
text[140]="Hey, Kalim. I've already gone through the first couple of pages and I'd like to ask you something."
text[141]="I'm not sure how you expect me to help, but okay. (She sure works fast.)"
text[142]="If I'm not mistaken, you had some sort of staff with you... It wouldn't happen to be capable of manipulating electricity, would it?"
text[143]="Oh, you noticed that stupid thing? Yeah, that's exactly what it does. You have to be very careful, though."
text[144]="You just point it in a direction of a charged object, place your hands like so and..."
text[145]="Are you okay? It sounded like something just broke..."
text[146]="I'M FEELING ABSOLUTELY MARVELLOUS."
text[147]="I DIDN'T BREAK ANYTHING. YET."
text[148]="WHAT WERE YOU ASKING, AGAIN?"
text[149]="...Okay, this is getting weird. But, in any case-"
text[150]="You should probably start heading towards the observation deck, since that is where the author seems to be spending much of his time."
text[151]="OBSERVATION DECK? NO, NO, NO, MISS VI. I CAN'T DO THAT. IT'S THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM THE HEAVENSCRAPER."
text[152]="CORRECT RESPONSE."
text[153]="Huh? What's the Heavenscraper got to do with this? Weren't you the one who wanted to find the author...?"
text[154]="Look, I'm going to be straight with you. I want to find whoever wrote this now. Pretty badly."
text[155]="HUH?"
text[156]="I've only just begun reading, and the author already seems like a very troubled individual."
text[157]="He writes in the very first entry from several years ago that he was so disappointed in our society that he actually considered undergoing a lobotomy to make the pain go away."
text[158]="(...WHAT'S A ''YEAR''?)"
text[159]="And he's a human, too, which makes his perspective all the more interesting."
text[160]="Luckily, he decided not to go through with it and stick with making cute little helper robots instead."
text[161]="Otherwise he'd be ''no better than all the other dead souls here.''"
text[162]="He seems a bit arrogant, but also adorable. kind of like you."
text[163]="The Lonely Seeker isn't exactly the best place for such people. You two are an endangered species. I really wonder how he's doing right now."
text[164]="I know I probably shouldn't be reading these personal bits, but... he sounds like he really needs someone who could lend an ear, you know?"
text[165]="(THIS IS GETTING ANNOYING.) WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT AND LOOK FOR HIM YOURSELF, THEN?"
text[166]="I can't really move around too much without getting exhausted. It would mean the world to me if you could connect us so that we could talk for a bit, at least remotely."
text[167]="Although... I'm not going to lie, as much as I want to meet him in person, someone like me would probably only further his disappointment."
text[168]="I know I'm asking a lot, but... can you find him and... cheer him up?"
text[169]="!"
text[170]="(THIS)"
text[171]="(IS)"
text[172]="(TOO)"
text[173]="(MUCH...!)"
text[174]="...Kalim?"
text[175]="I WILL FIND HIM, GRAB HIM BY THE ANKLES AND DRAG HIM ALL THE WAY TO YOU! FORCEFULLY!"
text[176]="HE WILL NEED BUT A SEOND IN YOUR PRESENCE TO BE FILLED WITH HOPE AGAIN!"
text[177]="I WILL TRAVEL TO THE SINGULARITY AND BACK TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS!"
text[178]="I HOPE YOUR GOONS HEARD THAT LOUD AND CLEAR, YOU HUNK OF METAL!"
text[179]="AFFIRMATIVE."
text[180]="Wait, what-"
text[181]="Gotta run, Miss Vi! Call you later!"
text[182]="I-I mean, I can find him myself if you-"
