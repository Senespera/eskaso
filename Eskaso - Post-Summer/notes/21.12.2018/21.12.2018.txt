Just to make it clear: I'm not using dating apps.
The concept is just too weird for me: 
"Hey, stranger! Here are all the goods things about me! Would you be willing to establish a meaningful connection with me now? Let's talk so I can screen you!"
That, or they're just looking for sex. 
Huh. I actually looked up Grindr. "Photos depicting nudity are strictly prohibited".
Apparently, it's just a social network for non-straight/trans people...? I guess all the Q&A about sex makes sense, then...?
...I'll download the app. NOT CREATING A PROFILE YET THOUGH. I'll have to test the waters somehow first. 
Call me paranoid. If the wrong people find out about this part of me, there will be consequences.
AAAAAAAA I CAN'T DO IT
I don't feel attracted to any of these people.
I guess I could just mark myself as not looking for sex or relationships for now.
Yes, that sounds reasonable. Still not uploading a pic.
I'll only fill out the blanks that I'm confident in. So, no "Tribes" or "Position".
Although I do wonder if I'd qualify as a twink.
Update: if I shave enough, I will, in fact, qualify as a twink, but I'm also apparently a jock.
I'm really not. No muscles. Not into muscles, either. Just smiles. I'm being serious.
...But if I do decide to go for it, I'll put down "Twink" and "Bottom".
