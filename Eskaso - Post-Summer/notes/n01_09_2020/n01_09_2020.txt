Damn, that was quite the break. I don't feel very recupperated, but whatever.
Fuck these new naming rules.
Fuck my anxiety. I must create something today.

Plan for now:
-Come up with a name for Dragon's Maw PRE
-Make that room
-Make a basic book object (pauses will come later)
-Make the basic cutscene (shakes will come later)

I shall name thee Dragon's Metro
