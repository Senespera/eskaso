16:15. Worked for about an hour.
No, I was not COMPLETELY slacking off. I was doing music and spritework.
Now I'm trying to figure oout how to make Heavenscraper and walls rotate consistently.
Mind you, I am yet to draw DD, Urumagh, Wrath, the final building and Stage screen, come up with new Superstitions,
and actually design the level.
Not to mention, I really want to remake the track and I have to learn to implement data gathering.
Work for ~ 2 weeks cut out for me, I guess.

heavenscraper should be front and center at frame 116 at 30(?)fps,
which means it's travelling at 3.8(6) pixels per... step? Let's test it.
Nope. Per second, then? Multiplying by 60...
Clearly not. I'm obviously wrong and I don't know why. 
30 doesn't cut it, either. Or maybe my starting point is wrong?
It should start at frame 103 and end at frame 129.
So... at a speed of 116 pixels per frame to be at 0 at frame 116... negative 116^2?
It's... consistent, but off. Cutting the speed... in half...? I'm just grasping at straws here.
Not quite. change distance to 116*116*2 instead?
Flies by too fast. changing the speed back to 58 and distance to 116^2.
Now to do what I do best. Spitballing the numbers till it's close enough.
-12000 is close enough. Now to attach walls and... go back to spritework?
Walls disappear. Which means I have to make heavenscraper go faster. Which means I have to put it further away.
Say... 70 and -12500? -13000? -14000? -14750?
16:53. Done. Now onto the spritework. I want to try out Dota 2 today, too.
