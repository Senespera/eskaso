My PC has risen from the ashes.
Time to try out my formulas.
No, I'm not feeling much better.

When going up, go BACKWARD IN TIME.
Nice.
Now do the same for the scale. Actually, tie it to the distance to the halfpoint? 80% min?

YES, IT'S IMPORTANT.
cut in half. cut what in half? 
eh, i'll try to x^3 this shit.

too rough. amped up to 120 fps.
30 fps...? i want to see MORE FRAMES through the SAME TIME PERIOD.
no. wait. it just doesn't reach.

They'll appear One Second (120 frames now) after their signal. Enemies' placeholders are unnecessary.
That's the plan, anyway.
