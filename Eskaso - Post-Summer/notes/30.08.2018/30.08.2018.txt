23:27. Obsession feels quite comfortable. It doesn't go away even after destressing. Not that I mind that.
I would rather be less productive than abandon this sweetness. Yes, I said it. 
...The darkest time in my life will begin when Obsession disappears.

0:19. Yup, my fears were unfounded. The box fits 5 LINES. In fact, I think the font is much too big.
I have been terribly unproductive today. What did I do? I scribbled #18.
Urgh. Maybe I should create several boxes. Not now, though. Won't work until I pick a font/size that I'll like.

...Just working with words isn't gonna be enough. My creativity for today's run out.

<infernal screams>
1. Smaller Boxes
2. Dash Economy
3. ...Finally construct the first level? Ho-ho-ho. No, right...? ...I must be terribly sleepy.
4. Oh, right. Collissions. I don't care if I keep misspelling it. Just kidding, I do, and I do a lot.
5. WALLS. IT'S TIME. THE DEMON HAS RETURNED TO BE VANQUISHED ONE LAST TIME.
6. YELLOW. Right. Probably the last thing required for 1-1 to work.
7. Doors. Never thought those would make a comeback.
8. Refill zones. I predict this one will be the easiest. -31.08.2018
9. Checkpoints? -31.08.2018
10.TryAgain? (scratch that. It's basically a cosmetic transition. The only nuance is determining direction)

0:40. There. Consider this a dift from yesterday. I did do quite a bit there. I still feel just as guilty, though.
Okay, never mind. This is secondary. Sorry, Stormwind. I'll go back to Light once I actually handle YELLOW.
