5:57. I'm a fucking creature of the night now. A motherfucking prince of darkness.
When I'm not working on Eskaso, I'm working on Childhood.
I hope I won't be tempted to start working on Romance of the Elements, too.
Or Dangerous Ideas. Or Adolf Hitler's Bizarre Adventure.

6:38. enemy should be ulprocket, but it's apparently not. I have no idea where to go here.

7:06. Putting that aside, drop doesn't drop EAF when it should.
7:15. I see. I got EAF when it showed BP. I just need to sync the two somehow.
7:25. Fuck, I forgot how I even set this shit up. What decides drop again?
7:49. Still not succeeding. I'll try binding it to sprite_index of Announcer. But first, my breakfast.
7:59. Breakfast done. Let's hope my mind is refreshed enough.
8:11. You know what? This won't work. The last disappearing Announcer will influence others.
Let me think.
8:34. God damn it. I took so long to implement this new bullshit system and it still doesn't work.
I'm metaphorically bashing my head against the wall.
8:41. I... I can't believe it. I changed countercounter and it all works fine now!
Now to make sure they spawn with the same period.
Fuck. Nevermind. Mistake again. It only seems to happen at the middle lanes.
Nevermind. It happens on lower levels, too. Let's run a couple more tests.
It happens everywhere and sometimes even on first spawns. I accomplished nothing.
Nevernevermind. It only happens mid again after I moved the resetting clause.
Nevernevernevermind. It happens... fuck it. Fuck everything. I don't know what the fuck to do.
And when I don't know what to do, I usually crash everything and start from square one.
But I don't want to...
9:16. Fine. Let the song end, watch some videos and brainstorm alternatives with GMS closed.

19:55. I had a good nap, now to fix things up.
...I'm drawing a blank.
20:19. Another failed attempt.
20:37. Did... did I do it? Finally? L-Let's deal with periodity, then.
I... I think I did it! The day was not wasted!
I added k collision and so far... looks difficult enough. I'll add OPF later. When all other mechanics are in place.

22:45. I'm too satisfied with myself to be angry at these new bugs:
1) Urumagh keeps appearing from the right after being cued
2) Right Urumagh only gets cued when very close by
And I don't know why either one happens.
22:52. Maybe I deserve a rest. My brain doesn't seem to work anymore.
But I'll feel guilty leaving after such a measly amount of progress...
Whatever. I'm not in the right state to be working. Bye. Maybe I'll draw children tomorrow instead.
