2:04. I DID IT - I SOLVED THE BRICK THING! By sending leftest to the right!
And I even playtested the level - the finale is close, but it's possible. Fine, I'll add just 1 more CP.

Now all that's left is the music. Oh, the music...
I guess I'll try to see what I can do about analytics next.
That probably takes precedence over more levels. And cutscenes.
Fuck, I hate learning.
