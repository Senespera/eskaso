17:41. Fucking bricks man, fucking bricks. Fuck them bricks man. 
I WANT to just let it go, but I do have at least some dev pride. 
Fine. Let's set off some time to see if anything can be done about it today.
If I come up with nothing, it's not too bad - I can always come back another time.
But just so we're clear, today's mission is just implementing the level. Minimal testing.
Oh, and fix DI pause thing. Probably should start with that. It'll be quick.

17:46. There were at least 2 ways of fixing that, but it'll do.
17:55. Fixed one problem, another pops up. Now after Game Over some bricks are furthering away.
Let's remove 8 for now and see how it plays out.
Not helping. Let's try moving to closest left brick. On Create because otherwise I'd have to move cracks too.

18:21. The game is lagging and the problem still isn't solved. But lagging is due to drawing, so nevermind.

19:04. Okay, okay. You tried and you failed. There is always a next time.
By the way, you seem to have forgotten the SF aura and you need to test new static delay.

19:18. 150 seems to work. Will crank it up to 160, though. Now onto the level.
19:25. Note to future self: tune SFt within t cases. It's dormant until activated anyway.

21:49. Holy fuck I've been procrastinating. Logging off.
