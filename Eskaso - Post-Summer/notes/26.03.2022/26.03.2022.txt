I'm a lazy piece of shit.
I promised myself I would create Rage in Solitude in March, but instead I sleep all day.
I swear after I make some stars bigger and make them rotate in ULP, I'll create Shameful Failure.
Then I'll be on my way to create the actual level.

21:20. Well, that was quick. The stars, I mean. Time for Shameful Failure. But first, Intermission 5!
So yeah, The Apple Scene will have to wait.

22:03. Remember to add sounds to DI and SF.

22:57. Well, what do you know. I implemented SF.

Agenda for the next time:
Make sounds for DI and SF
Level Design (static or no?)
Sprites
Music

Probably won't make it by April, but still. I can at least try to stick to schedule.
Now to decide between FFXIV and drawing homoromantic art. Decisions, decisions...
