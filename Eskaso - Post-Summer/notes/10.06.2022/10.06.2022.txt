Perhaps mandatory practice isn't such a bad thing.
My brother arrives in ~4 hours, let's see how much I can do till then.
I haven't come up with a level yet, so I'll just launch practice fate.

14:56. Jesus Tapdancing Christ, I forgot to time it again. Been working for about 2 hours.
Also, I have a week to both make it work and complete a diploma. 
Whatever, there's always nighttime energy. Sleeeeeeeeepy.
I'll spawn some Wraths and make button (as opposed to reactionary) based slash and shoot.
After that, who knows? But I'll probably not be working. 
Although there's still an explosion sprite...

15:34. Done and Done.
