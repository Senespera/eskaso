14:56- If I copy-paste this enough times, I'll be driven mad enough to actually handle it

Cue/Bump Redifferentiation
Dash Economy
17:21- Kalim and Eskaso are now one. Eh, might as well draw those 16 placeholders - dunnedly diddliddy done

YAY!!!NEW CUE!!!YAY
When in mid-position, YAY!!!DO NOTHING!!!YAY
When in either edge-position, release a HUGE STRESSWAVE that pretty much covers half the directions
BUT ONLY MOMENTARILY- return to pseudo-mid state after half a second or something- which just makes Kalim eligible for Bump, right?
Example- East: StressWave covers Eastern side of N, NE, E, SE and Eastern side of S.
And make sure you send the fucker flying- or set cuecd until far enough.
(maybe don't even cue. huh. well, that was quite a roundabout)
So... no eskaso collission event necessary. Just the StressWave.

EXCEPT
B U M P   R E W O R K
If some f u c k  bumps into Kalim OR Eskaso WHILE in mid-position, 
Make the said fuck bump off just a little bit- much weaker than if they were cued.
Maybe even have Bump be a universal event since Kalim will basically do the same thing.

...Hold the fuck up. Why do I even need Eskaso as an object anymore?
...I don't, right? It's only treated as a separate entity in that one cutscene- but I can even cut that with no problems.
SOUNDS LIKE A WORTHY ADDITION TO TODAY'S AGENDA!

19:02. It works fine. I'm crossing my fingers hoping it'll look pretty if the sprites are pretty.
What about Dash sprites, though? Ah, I'll probably just make 4 separate sprites for that. Not even 8.

19:25. You know what? I might regret it later, but I don't feel like removing Eskaso from Eskaso for a variety of reasons.
I'll remove all collission events and basically demote it to the Hand (controller) role.

19:48. am I toO tIREd to GO oN? ArgH. BaSicalLy, tHiS is MY BraIN's stICKING pOIInt:
Eskaso kinda sticks out. StressWave is too far away.
But. The final sprite. Will be different.
So fuck it. Just. Move the origin. For now.
19:57. I don't like something. Drown it with variables.
20:04. Me WeE bRAiN: Stop. Take a break. Rest. Stop.
Me: 8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
20:09. There's something else I want to do: visual cues. Right? How will it look like? 
ARGH YOU KNOW WHAT FUCK IT SHE'LL RETRACT A LITTLE THEN CUE A LITTLE (WITH STRESSWAVE) AT EVERY SPRITE
It won't be that much effort. Just move her bloody arms 4-16 times*2.
Laaaaaaaaaaaaast thing fooooooooooooooooooor todaaaaaaaaaaaaaay becaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaause siiiiiiiiide efeeeeeeeects are reaaaaal
Make it so that front cue and back cue  are not recharged at the same time as the other one is activated. CueCD? 'COURSE!
20:27. OKAY BEAUTIFUL COULD REALLY USE SOME VISUAL CUES BUT MY BRAIN FEELS LIKE IT'S BEEN DOING HOMEWORK

22:37. There's something I seem to have been forgetting to write down- I've surrenderred to the Obsession.
I want to prolong it for as long as I can. I need that sweetness. I need that hope. Something to dream of.
...I'm not sure which dream is less real at this point.
I'm going to try to write something for her. Never to be seen by her or anyone else, of course.

Not exactly empty, and yet not quite insane
I have been working in seclusion
On what would never see the light of day.
But amidst that laughable confusion

I felt a gentle touch.

I knew quite well that it was an illusion
And that it, too, would never come to pass,
But I'd abandoned far too much in my pursuit of retribution,
Like a hope being cherished by a sweet and charming lass.

My mind was certainly disfigured:
Doomed to hurt, to wonder, and to make up silly rhymes,
But it filled me up with vigor
And pushed me even farther to attain my phantom prize.

Wow, I got a bit carried away. I'd better get back to work.
...Not gonna lie, though. I liked at least that last line. Come on, it's pretty sweet.

23:20. ...Why not take a break from all this? 
No, not like that. I meant the dialogue. It's kind of where the best stuff's gonna be.
Guess I might as well boot up that tutorial and see what I can tweak.
I've always been afraid that my long sentences won't fit neatly into that little box.
I am feeling slightly perplexed after reading back that last sentence.
Anyway, I've decided that I'm going to model the boxes after Ace Attorney.
Actually, let's look back at all the other boxes.
Cinders: quite weak boxes.
Solstice: ugh. will definitely ruin the atmosphere.
Fire Emblem Awakening: closer, but still too far away.
Ace Attorney: just like that. transparent, stylish, and offering plenty of space. If I use it properly.
