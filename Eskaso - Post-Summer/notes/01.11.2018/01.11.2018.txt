23:19. Finished SURVEY_PROGRAM today. My heart feels cared for. I think Obsession took a step back, too.
My tests' results are going to be unimpressive.
Good.
I'm not a student first. Neither am I a friend, a gamer, a citizen, a man, a liberal, an atheist or a tea addict first.
I'm Eskasisto.
No more Wasted Time.
Let's get it on.

 Let's adjust dat speed!
 And Make that RB into SD!
 I'll RP as an oldie and reverse the scale instead of just dumping a reversed sprite.
  wait. no. the octangle thing. i got it wrong this time.
  LOOK LEFT, GO LEFT- Xscale=-1
  LOOK LEFT, GO RIGHT- Xscale=-1
  ah, i won't actually have to change much.
  
Some sprites i shan't forget: standing, cued back (45,90,135,225,270,315. Maybe modify 0,180 later)
0:26. Can't say I expected to be productive today.
