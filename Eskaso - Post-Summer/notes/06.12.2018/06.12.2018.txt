18:06. I'm a joke and a fraud.
You can't prove me wrong until you put something together.
Self-loathing aside, though... I've been thinking.
Wouldn't making the game on-rail add to the whole "no choice" expression?
I'm being serious. I know that this dilemma is probably older than Eskaso itself, but...
Really- take a look at the level map and tell me you can't easily remake it!
(side note: Eskaso is kind of a personal thing and I'm trying to keep my new roommate from asking questions)
Let me think. I'm getting ideas. New ideas. Gameplay that is actually good. That's new.
