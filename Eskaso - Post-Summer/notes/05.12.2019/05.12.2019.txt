Been drawing, had an idea-
Regarding this whole cueing thing:
Once the enemy is Halfway There, fade and become harmless and uncueable
(by turning into one's degenerate brother)

done it. 
i think i'll fix the SW spawning bug and be done for tonight.

something's up with coordinates.
or, rather, something's up with me not understanding where things spawn.
regardless, it's workable for now and I have to not push myself.
