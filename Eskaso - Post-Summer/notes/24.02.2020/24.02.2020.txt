I've decided to cut shishkebab altogether. It's just too confusing for the player.

So, my plan so far is:
1. Redact the level spawns
2. Add the level finish (the claw appearing, DD's stopping, Kalim going in, level switching)
3. Spice up game overs

did the first two, except i want to find a way to gradually reduce volume.
