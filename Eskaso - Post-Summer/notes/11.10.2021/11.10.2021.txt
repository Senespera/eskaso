Imported  and gave the sprites more recognizable names.

Ugh. Getting tired. Must press on. Progress has to be made.
When "...!", have arm move [-32-0]x, and on the next frame have it move the negative of that value.
Jittering. Whatever. Maybe I'll fix that sometime later. It kinda fits, too.
Made the value smaller, looks smoother. 

if k.hit==true, drag leftward until xx-x>=val. Then, after a pause hit=false, karm.hit=true.
drag arm leftward until x==k.x. Then, after a pause karm.hit=false, k.hit=true

fuck it, i can't focus anymore. read it when you're more prapared.
