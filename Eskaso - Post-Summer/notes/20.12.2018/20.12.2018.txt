I'll probably name my next note folder after I arbitrarily finish it. This is another one for the Gay Shit Collection. Here we go.
To be clear, I currently believe that I'm probably bisexual. 
I really, really, really don't want to make these kinds of judgements before checking them by having a meaningful experience with someone, though.
But, if I had to put myself on a spectrum... I don't know. Would it even make sense to make it a Male-Female spectrum?
I guess I'm also demisexual, and I only ever had crushes on different people. So, never got to love someone after getting to know them.
Actually, I'm not sure if those were crushes anymore. I mean, I'm having a similar thing right now, but with an abstract "guy".
Can one have a crush on an abstract concept with no distinct qualities?
Who cares. I'm getting sidetracked. So, where would I put myself on the spectrum? The only thing I can say with confidence is that I love cuteness.

I've just unanonimized my profile. Let them crack down on me for posting whatever. I don't care. I'm making myself searchable. If anyone's interested.
Might even upload a pic if I feel cute later.
Next. Some kind of a signal that I'm open to meeting guys. Because I'm sure as hell not the initiator type. Yet. Let me try to find something.
Might as well ask one of those gay-hunting groups what things they look for, right? "How to spot a sodomite". I'll try that, actually.
Well, shucks. I do none of those things! And they didn't even mention paying attention to one's appearance! Come on, at least give me that!
I guess my best bet is... to act more girly...? I mean, that sounds fun as hell, but... Actually, no. No buts. This is perfect. 
It's settled, then. Behaving in a way that would unnerve every fundamentalist out there, starting today.
So, should I start working on my hips, or on my voice and manner of speech? Maybe I should start shaving my body hair, starting with hands.
