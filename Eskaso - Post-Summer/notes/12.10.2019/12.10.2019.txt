introduce 2 variables: lefthere and righthere
tie them to the rail. set true when blinks from left/right, set false when disappear
-IDEA INTERMISSION-
why not just SIPHON superstitions instead of catching them? yeah, let's just do that.
next, if true
 if d/a is being held
  create a cue origin, a cue destination, and a cue that is stretched out properly.
  if an enemy has yet to spawn, target a point outside the screen.
  
  if missed, color cyan. or white. white would probably be less confusing.
  you'll probably want to create some properly colored overlay sprites.
  if hit, color appropriately and apply the effect while cancelling the spawn or pushing back.
  
it's clunky, but i'll have lefthere be for the spawned and leftcoming for those yet to spawn.
