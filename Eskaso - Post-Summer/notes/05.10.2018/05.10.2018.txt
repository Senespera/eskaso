22:55. I don't know what I'm going to do today, but dammit I'm going to finally make some progress on this fucking game.

-Dash Economy. Implement it.
-The timer. Make it smaller.
-The sprite. Until it's finalized, I can't construct a level.

First, just to get myself back into the hang of things, the timer.
23:02. I'm fast as fuck boooooooooooooooooooooooi

Dash Economy. This is a big one. Not sure you'll be able to do it quickly en-
DO IT.
I'm thinking something like little tiny bars right above the timer.

23:52. Yes. Fuck you. I did it. Basically on the first try. Now, the sprite. I can have another hour, I say!
...It's all about the lines. And sizes. I should probably use the sprite dimensions on the canvas, too.
Let me try to visualize it one more time before switching to Krita.

0:00. Urgh. No use. I'm too tired. I'll visualize it later in the handbook.
Goddamit, I'm so jealous of people who can work at night just fine.
...I think I should still be able to write, though.

Least to most taxing activities: Writing, Gamemaking, Drawing, Composing.
