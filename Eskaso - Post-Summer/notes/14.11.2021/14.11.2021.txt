Copied 09.11.2021 notes into the notepad.
Let's see what I can be fucked to do today.

Added checkpoint signifier.
Slowed down AuRe energy consumption

Why the fuck does real i not work as it's supposed to?
Found a roundabout way to do it. Will split up more lines.
Cut all but 2 lines from being over 3 lines long.

Welp, it's been about 2 hours. I'm justified in playing some games now.
Hopefully tomorrow I'll make some progress on non-GameMaker points.
