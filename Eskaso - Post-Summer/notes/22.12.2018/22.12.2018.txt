I swear to god, it's like a floodgate opened inside my mind.
I don't want to do anything else.
I just want to lie in bed and fantasize about having a loving boyfriend.
This is not depression. I think.
My mind refuses to work. I think I've just been forgetting to drink my tea.
I should spend the next day productively. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to.
It wouldn't make any sense to work today. I am currently inept.
I will spend the rest of the night indulging my fantasies.
God, my standards are getting unrealistic. I feel like a girl wishing for a prince.
Except my prince is even less likely to exist.
I have to do something. I have to find the one. Or make it possible for him to find me.
Somewhere out there, there's a guy thinking the same thing as me.
He's waiting for someone like me.
It's thoughts like this that give me hope.
I forgot what it feels like.
