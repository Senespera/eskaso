12:35. My PC clock is set 5 minutes early, and my internal clock is doing a fucking John Travolta dance with its hands
Can't really complain now, though. This is going to be a productive day. I'm a little less tired.
The obsession keeps me in bed just the same, but it's been getting... less rewarding. It's hard not to feel sad.
I mean, I'd rather it go away completely, but... I can't think of anything that would feel nearly as sweet.
13:33. PINK EP is done.
You know what? I really have no excuse for using sp_energy placeholder. I mean, how hard can it be to draw an actual good sprite?
15:20. I believe that unsettling man said that 4 hours of non-stop work is the limit. Well, I'm making plenty of stops. Too many.
15:28. See?
16:09. My mind is either running too fast or too slow. Either way, I still have enough motivation to do EV.

I just need to write down the order of events somewhere. Energy Vampire!
1. An enemy is set as glowing in a particular color. For now, just put it in the Create event.
2. When the enemy OR the Light is RMB'd (probably just make it the Light if that's how it works), decrease the latter's size with distance
3. When the mouse is far enough from the Light, yank out a particular color and delete the Light.

16:25. So...
1. Create a script that creates a Light of a particular color
2. I forgot.

16:40. I ain't any good right now, huh?
