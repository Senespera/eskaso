23:04. Now onto the hardest Superstition ever created - Dreadful Cycle.
I suppose writing its mechanism down to the letter will make things easier.
Acquisision is the same as the others, just find the right sound effect.
Upon collision, if not already affected, freeze timer and fate
make the static gain alpha, drowning out the level's track
with the sound of static. Delete starmaker, urumagh and all the stars. Make bg objects invisible.
Then, after some time, the static and its sound subside,
revealing khr's, windows, stars , track and dd of AuRe.
Then, activate (perhaps with some modification) fate.
After fate reaches a certain point, freeze timer and fate, make static gain alpha, drown out the track,
delete starmaker and all the stars, make bg objects invisible.
Then, before subsiding, spawn urumagh back, unfreeze timer and fate (after subtracting 1.5 seconds),
spawn starmaker, make bg objects visible, disable dcd
then, make track loud again.
If the player somehow loses while dcd, dcd is turned off.
I think that's it. Will modify if needed.

1:02. What is taking my roommate so long in the bathroom? He's been there for at least an hour and a half.
But while he's there, I might as well keep moving. So, turning on our fate...
1:09. Yay, they came out. My excuse to wrap it up. I basically did most of the work anyway. 
Something like that, anyway. Don't let a day go by.
