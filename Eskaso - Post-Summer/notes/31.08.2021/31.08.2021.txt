7:55. Fuck I'm unmotivated, but it has to be done eventually. Lunges must spawn.
Oh. I think I got it. It only works for yellow blinks. Let me change that.
8:22. Nope. Still something screws it up... occasionally.

It also stops following k after some time. Should be a hint.
Now blink also centers on k when it should be above. I am breaking things.
Okay... 1. Fall sometomes centers on k.
2. Cannon sometimes moves with k
3. Rage Lunge blink doesn't move with k
4. Rage unmoving Lunge drops CP when long cued

Okay, regarding 4. I think Urumagh moves to the wrong direction, since long cue may take a while to hurl CP.
Yup. I forgit to put a minus on the right one. Checking...
Yes. That seems to have been the problem. But now the CP it drops spawns Fall for some reason.
I'll just switch it all to BP for now.

4 and 3 dealt with. Now to see wtf is wrong with 1.?
I... I think I dealt with 1. And I haven't seen 2 in a while... I guess I could add Urumagh's HP bar...?
Done. And oh- I forgot to add a bunch of blinks during rage transformation.

10:26. I expected something prettier, but whatever. Now to fix hp for energy. 
I'll have to find the right sounds for the end and the transformation soon.

11:17. Wow, time flies. I guess now's the time for sounds. Bye, GameMaker.
