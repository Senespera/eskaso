21:12. I guess I should flesh out the different cue outcomes in my head.
...Maybe I SHOULDN'T make a distinction between hitting Kalim and hitting Eskaso? I mean,
It would only look less natural. Other than that, it's back to the Cueless system...?
21:42. Still trying to think. 
Come to think of it, I probably won't be arsed to program a way for Kalim's limbs to move smoothly.
NEW RCCUE (really needs a name): DIVIDE THE SCREEN INTO THIRDS AND ONLY HAVE THREE ESKASO POSITIONS
what is wrong with my brain? i've been getting distracted the whole day. nothing helps. restless sleep?
ARGH! JUST KEEP WRITING AND main tain fo... cus... .................................................
22:00. You know what? Why not create a bunch of placeholders right fucking now? Let's count:
8 directions of movement, right? Wrongk. It's 4 now. Why? Because I said so. Fuck you.
Okay, think about it: you go right while looking to the right, right?
And then, you start going up. So, NE. What would look better? A slight change in the sprite or no change at all?
This is not a rethorical question. I am genuinely clueless as to how to change sprites.
22:13. I'm gonna fucking hate myself if I end this day so unproductively. I CAN'T EVEN BLOODY COUNT
OKAY FINE LET'S CHANGE THE SUBJECT THEN JESUS CHRIST
New enemy type. Yes. Yes, please. I mean, not the new new. Tower/Safety Net.

22:18. OKAY, AN HOUR OF WAILING LATER, I FINALLY GET TO WORK. LET'S BUILD THAT TOWER BOI
getting distracted for the last time: i probably won't handle 64 sprites just for Kalim.
Kommissar will probably have less than 32, too. Revert to 4 directions?
Okay, fuck. RESISTOR. COOL. 8 DIRECTIONS. PROJECTILES, TOO. BIG ONES. Should compensate for limited accuracy.
Maybe Pacifier will have homing lasers or something.

0:06. Done. Kinda underwhelming. Maybe I'll finally get back to music tomorrow. 
I guess I might as well experiment with the blinking timer
0:19. Verdict: it might be a good idea to mess around with alpha instead. Tomorrow.
Sometimes epilepsy isn't the best option.
