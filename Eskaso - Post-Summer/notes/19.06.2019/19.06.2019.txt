Hi, my name is Nadya now.
Ivan is my deadname.
My parents know that I need medical help.
They tend to use the word "transsexual".
If I tell them to stop calling me "Vanya" or "Son", they will probably listen.
But I am absolutely useless.

This was objectively the easiest term, and I am sitting in my dorm right now, skipping colloqium.
I had been trying to study, but I... I just can't. It's too much.
It used to wreck me emotionally for some reason, but now I can't even bring myself to start.
I didn't expect my parents to be supportive enough to comfort me when I tell them this.
At least someone doesn't think I'm slacking off.

I don't want to be a burden.
But I can't do anything.
I don't want to live like this.
At least give me the bloody hormones.
If I hate my body, and if I am my body, I hate myself.

I don't know what my life will be like when I'm out of the uni.
A delusional, miserable financial burden.
I want to run away from it all.
But I'm just too afraid to die.
And, as pathetic as it sounds, I still want to experience mutual love.

This game just might be my only realistic Hope And Dream.

I predict that this will also be a fairly short-lived period.
At least I'll try to create the cosmetics of Lazerboy.
Done it. Now... back to being useless?
