I didn't plan on having this much of a break, but anxiety is a bitch
There's still this paralyzing feeling in my heart, but I must carry on.

Plan for now:
1. Finish the level spawns
2. Finish implementing the checkpoint (game overs)
3. Add the ending

i did finish the spawns just now, but there's another phantom and i'm just
urgh.
too tired for hunting.
i'll save the bug hunting for after i finish the level.
yeah, that sounds like a reasonable idea.
