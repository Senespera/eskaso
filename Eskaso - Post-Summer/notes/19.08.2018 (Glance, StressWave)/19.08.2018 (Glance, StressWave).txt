22:55. Three tasks for today

1) Make Cue work
I should probably leave this for last. This is too programmy.
0:11. Too late? The debate will go on for another hour. Less than that if I skip Q&A.
Hmm. I could restrict Kalim-com collission, but... I'd probably have to do something about repeated ones. And I can't in this state.
0:23. What am I doing again?
Umm... Maybe... it's colliding with both Kalim and Eskaso...? I should restrict that somehow.
0:28. I appreciate the fact that the time is slowing down for me, but my mind is not.
0:34. Khtlui, escanogh furitaphoxh phkhatrophliz krentobro zharuish
0:35. Oh. Right. I thought I'd put together a 1~10 step cooldown. CueCD.

2) Create, test and rename Cuesector. Also, rename the day.
I wonder if I'll be able to muster the strength to create an adequate sprite to toy around with after Turning.
StressWave...? Are you sure? ...There's something there.
Argh. Its charge and attack are swapped and... why not just swap them?
Done. A sober mind should be able to judge its merit tommorrow.

3) IDEA: Use Q/E or Mouse Wheel to change cueangle on the fly.
This one should be easy enough. Rename the day after doing it.
I must come up with a cool name, too. Turning just won't do.
23:14. First attempt- one-line solution. Three, two, one... 
WAIT WAIT WAIT I DIDN'T TEST IT YET IT DOESN'T COUNT FORGOT TO ADD PRESSED CHECK SHUT UP
23:17. Dang it. Different pressed check in Step. Guess I should suspend octangle and not image_angle there.
23:18. Yeah, it works. Of course it works. So disappointing. I didn't even need to name this mechanic. But I will.
