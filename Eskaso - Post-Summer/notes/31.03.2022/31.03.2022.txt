I'm a fat piece of shit, so to remedy that I decided not to eat out or buy anything today.
Now I'm laying with an open can of beans and without energy.
I'm implementing bricks, cracks, lights and DI/SF sounds.
After that, perhaps, I'll eat said can of beans. Perhaps then I'll have some energy to do homework.

18:52. That took way too long and I still can't believe my method worked.
Cracks should be easier.
Actually, let's get lights out of the way first.

19:03. Done. Now onto cracks. Should make the stage look lookable.

19:13. Noticed that bricks are close together, which causes cracks to "duplicate", but FUCK man.
I am in no mood to do ANYTHING - FUCK me. Maybe undereating isn't the best strategy, all things considered.
Oh well, what am I going to do? Spend 5 minutes to buy something?
...
I mean, they're open til 23:00...
I'll eat the beans and then I'll consider it, okay?
