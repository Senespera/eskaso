aaaand all my notes are only accessible through explorer. just great.
anyway,

Plan for now:
-Come up with a name for Dragon's Maw PRE
-Make that room
-Make a basic book object (pauses will come later)
-Make the basic cutscene (shakes will come later)

Dragon's Metro

Fucking anxiety is still here. I feel terrible.
Undertale soundtrack helps a little.

19:51. I created the basic book and created a basic room. The hard stuff I'll leave for later.
Hopefully tomorrow. I feel like I've been pushing myself.
