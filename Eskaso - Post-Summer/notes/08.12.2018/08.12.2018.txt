So, this is it, huh? The DEADLINE. All right, you lazy piece of shit. Surprise me.
I want rails to do all kinds of weird twists and turns. Don't limit them to h/v.
Therefore, Kalim should have a way to switch between different kinds of rails.
If it's not X/Y that should remain constant, what is?
Actually, fuck the weird twists and turns. I probably won't even get that far. Anytime soon.
But what about the rhombus? WELL. You see, the lanes are related to each other- they run parallel.

Therefore, when swapping, simply lengthdir to the desired lane. It's that simple.

Okay, what about automatic swapping? That's an easy one-
fuck, am i raelly stuck on such an easy point?
I mean- have a hand that manually changes the rail and destroys (or, rather, marks "passed" for the crosser) the other rail

OKAY FUCK NOTES JUST BUILD THE THING WITHOUT THE RHOMBUS- SCRAP THE OLD MOVE AND EVERYTHING
Intermission: how do i make the baddies freely move onto the next rail?
Cuz marking the rails as "passed" applies to everyone. What if I want the koms to come after Kalim?
Fuck, this cannot be this complicated. YOU TOUCH IT- YOU JUMP ON IT. THERE.
No going back. Unless I say otherwise.
What are you staring at? You're behind schedule already. DO IT.
