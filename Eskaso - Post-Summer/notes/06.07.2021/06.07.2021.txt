As it turns out, I already had DM level designed. 
Hell, I even had an ugly Pre-(Un)Limited Power backdrop drawn.
But I did draw EAF tutorial card and shield. Time to implement stuff. But first, fate.

That took a while to transcribe. Am I actually going to make a hard game?
Bug noticed: sometimes I get hit at a precise frame when spawning occurs, leading to hordes of enemies.
Should I fix it? I probably should fix it now.

Wow, I... I think I just made a level! And a good one, too!
And I still don't know how I will ever make the next one!
Fine, fine, fine. My current objective is the pre-scene. 
I think I'll remove the sludge and call it a day as far as background goes.
