okay, maybe not literally tomorrow.
time to import the timeline

what the fuck
Why do I miss cues?
therail.right/left seems to work...

I see - righthere doesn't activate for some reason.
Why is this happening...?
apparently, it starts out as true, but then goes to false...?

FUCK IM SO CLOSE BUT MY HEAD CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE
Basically, I think righthere sets to false whenever koms despawn on teir own
which happens after other koms spawn with righthere=true
in other words, don't set it to false if...
theiral.right>=2...?
in other words, set it to false if theiral.right<2?
I WON'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH MYSELF IF I LEAVE IT HERE
wait what if i just continuously set it tu true when they're alive?
SAME ERROR AS IN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGHH
i am literally mentally falling apart.
i am afraid if i don't finish it now then it's all done
i don't even know how i would rework all of this...

you know what? i'll just go back ro the range of 2.5 per encounter.
fuck my worthless ass. fuck me. fuck fuck shit fuck shit shit fuck cunt fuck
