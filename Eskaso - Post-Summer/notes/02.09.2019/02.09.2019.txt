Welp, I mean... I did do it.
...That was surprisingly simple.
I should feel satisfied.
But I feel nothing.
I've still got an hour until I can rank up in Warframe.

No way I'm gonna put more work into it today. I'll just disappoint myself.
I should just learn to set appropriate goals instead.

Next time, create a manual spawning system.
-Spawn from either/both sides
-Spawn enemies (still placeholder sprites)
-Blink- with an aura and all- and then spawn after One Second.
-Firin' Ma Lazor drops the drop.
