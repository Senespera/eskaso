Goal for today: complete the basic mechanics.
Should be simple enough.
Level design is a whole science in and of itself.
I'll need to come up with a language for writing it down, too.
I reckon it'll look something like musical notes.
Will I synchro it later with the soundtrack? Maybe. Maybe the other way around.
No matter. Let's get this easy part out of the way first.

14:22- I spent basically all this time drawing Superstitions instead.
Maybe I need a detailed plan:

If no enemies are in sight, lazerboy.

Else- xscale protolazerboy accordingly,
hit the spot where needed,
cue the enemy away,
and drop the drop.

14:46. I'd much rather make dinner and take a break, though.
This is going to be another unproductive day, isn't it...?
