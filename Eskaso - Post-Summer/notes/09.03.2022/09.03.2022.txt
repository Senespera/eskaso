1:06. It's pretty late and the classes start at 10 so I'm only here out of an obligation.
Stars and nothing more.
I'm thinking 0-5 yellow.
I was going for 6-10 red, but who knows? After all, we don't see the colored stars in the night sky.
Or do we? On Earth or in space? Let me look it up...
Wow. We can even see blue ones? Now that I think about it, that would look pretty neat.
It's decided. yellow, red, blue. Why? Because Kalim's eye is better than human one.
I might even revamp all the previous scenes. I'll create another Hand to create the stars.
The quantity of stars as well as the x/y range will depend on the room.
Now, achtung!

1:27. It's...beautiful. Increasing size variability...
I don't see the difference, but damn does it look good. Adding 50 more stars...
You know what? Fuck my roommate. I'm implementing this shit in EVERY ROOM RIGHT FUCKING NOW.
1:49. All in a night's work. I think I deserve some more recreation before sleep.
Not setting myself up for a sleepy morning at all...
