23:19. Don't worry, Stormwind. I'm not going to overwork myself today, either.
I just wanted to destroy my cognitive dissonance: am I working too little or too much?
On one hand, I've been working and making progress basically every day.
On the other hand, only around half of my day is spent on Eskaso (including outside GameMaker). Maybe less, like today.
I mean, other people work on their stuff so much... It isn't healthy, but I just wish-
Stop. That's not how you should think. And not because looking up to masochists is bad. I can't do much about that.
Do you FEEL you've been working too much?
...Pathetically, yes.
Don't be ashamed. Use doublethink. Or destroy it. Ultimately, whatever happens, happens.

0:05. I took a personality test and it was just as confused about the things I care about as I am.
I also discovered Dream Theatre and bought three of their albums. 
Including Octavarium. Even though I barely listened to it. Because 8. I have no self-control.

Today's work summarized (yes, I still work on something every day. 27.08. could've been a exception. I don't remember.):
#26 sketched.
All levels named.
Rest taken. Or not. Whatever. Doesn't matter if you FEEL rested. It only matters whether you ARE rested.

I also skipped a meal today. 
I usually don't go to sleep that early, but I feel like I've been ignoring my feelings for a while now.
Even though I simultaneously feel like I pay too much attention to my feelings.
ANYWAY, REASON IS UNRELIABLE! WHAT'S THE HEALTHIER EXTREME? THEN IT'S DECIDED- GOING TO SLEEP NOW. BYE.
