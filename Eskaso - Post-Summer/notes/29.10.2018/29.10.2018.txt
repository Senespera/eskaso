Now, I know what you're probably thinking.
No, I wasn't just wasting my time.
I GOT A BUNCH OF IMPORTANT SPRITES READY TO GO BABY.
Perhaps I'll actually be motivated now. There's barely over a month left till my deadline.
Education can wait. Eskaso can't.
Actually, it's kind of the opposite. Maybe I should study up on physics today?
BUT FIRST I JUST WANT TO SEE THESE THINGS PUT TOGETHER.

Create a test room with:
Kalim going right
Kommissar pursuing her
(Where should the origin be?)
A road with redwalls placed where needed
A khrushchyovka
A working back-stresswave

But first, compare resizes. We've got: Krita, Paint.net, Gamemaker.
Current width resize is 66,4452%.
Paint.net - best quality method is the clear victor here. Now to run every sprite through it.
16:55. Done. Now it's time to actually do something in GameMaker.

I almost feel satisfied. This looks beautiful.
How about... if you go EEB, but your camera points to the right, move it to the left after charging?
