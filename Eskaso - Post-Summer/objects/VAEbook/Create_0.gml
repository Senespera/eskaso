//Urumagh
text[0]="Heh. That was entertaining, I'll give you that."
text[1]="Now if I could just move my arm a little..."
text[2]="...!"
text[3]="Damn."
text[4]="I hate to admit it, but the armor is a little heavier than I'd like."
text[5]="Having all energy sucked out of me doesn't help much, either. I can barely move a muscle."
text[6]="Oh well. Even if the girl recovers before I do, there's no way she'll be able to drag herself all the way here."
text[7]="What?! How are you still able to move?! Didn't you have all your energy drained as well?!"
//Kalim
text[8]="I did."
text[9]="I'm just used to it."
text[10]="(I don't want any blood on my hands. Even if it's someone who has just tried to kill me.)"
text[11]="You! Help him take off his armor!"
text[12]="He needs immediate medical attention! If he isn't treated as soon as possible, he might literally fall apart!"
//Mortanimo
text[13]="A fitting punishment, I say. I don't think he could ask for a better way to go."
//Kalim
text[14]="*sigh*"
text[15]="They have a point..."
//Mortanimo
text[16]="And if I may, it would be more accurate to refer to me as ''it'', if you don't mind..."
//Kalim
text[17]="(It has a point. Maybe it'd be for the best. The sector will probably sigh with relief, too...)"
text[18]="..."
text[19]="(No. Evil people are never this self-destructive. This wasn't malice - just desperation.)"
text[20]="(There just has to be some really good reason he wants Eskaso if he's willing to kill someone over it.)"
text[21]="..."
text[22]="(...Okay, Kalim. Maybe you hit your head just a little too hard. Maybe you should just take a nap or something. Maybe defending a dictator is just a little too silly.)"
text[23]="(I guess I could ask him about his goals, but I can't do that while he's on his deathbed.)"
text[24]="In that case... I'm afraid you're on your own, big guy."
text[25]="It must feel nice when people constantly praise you for disregarding your health for the sake of the greater good, but in the end..."
text[26]="The kind of pain not even your armor can drown out."
text[27]="..."
text[28]="And I don't want you to pass on before you make a positive change in this world."
text[29]="And I know you don't, either."
//Urumagh
text[30]="..."
text[31]="First I'm defeated by some girl, and then she rubs it in by lecturing me..."
text[32]="The spirits are really testing me tonight."
text[33]="I thought you were old enough to get this, but you're clearly not. So let me break it to you."
text[34]="Life is all about taking punches and pushing onward."
text[35]="The best moments in life are the ones when you get hit the hardest you've ever been - and keep going anyway." 
text[36]="Live fast... die young... and you'll have no regrets..."
//Kalim
text[37]="Go ahead and die, then!"
//Urumagh
text[38]="..."
//Kalim
text[39]="...I'm sorry. I didn't mean it."
text[40]="(This is so frustrating. I'm really bad at this.)"
text[41]="(*sigh* I'm so tired...)"
text[42]="Tell you what, if you stay alive... we can have a rematch."
text[43]="That's right. You and me, one on one. There. I'm challenging you. Can't bow out now."
text[44]="...Coward."
//Urumagh
text[45]="..."
text[46]="...Heheh."
//Kalim
text[47]="?"
//Urumagh
text[48]="Hahaha."
text[49]="Ahaha."
text[50]="AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
text[51]="You are way too naive to be a descendant of a graverobber. You do realize I've just tried to murder you without even hearing you out, right? And I almost did!"
text[52]="And now you're willing to go through all that again just to save some crazy bastard's life?"
text[53]="For the first time in decades, I feel genuinely sorry. For you, that is."
text[54]="People will be constantly trying to take advantage of your misplaced empathy."
text[55]="I wonder just how far you'll be able to get in life with such a stupid attitude..."
//Kalim
text[56]="I guess you'll just have to live a bit longer to find out."
//Urumagh
text[57]="..."
text[58]="Deal."
text[59]="Good luck, kid. You'll really need it."
//Kalim
text[60]="Thanks."
//Urumagh
text[61]="I don't want this weapon anymore. If anyone's gonna do something great with that thing, it's you. And it'll probably do a lot more good in your hands."
text[62]="I'll find some way to ''make a positive change'' without it."
text[63]="...''Positive change''..."
text[64]="Yeah... That sounds like something I could shout while I'm busy stomping the real enemy of the station..."
text[65]="What are you planning to do with this thing, anyway?"
//Kalim
text[66]="..."
text[67]="Honestly, I have no idea."
